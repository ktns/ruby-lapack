:fortran_help: "      SUBROUTINE CHPCON( UPLO, N, AP, IPIV, ANORM, RCOND, WORK, INFO )\n\n\
  *  Purpose\n\
  *  =======\n\
  *\n\
  *  CHPCON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number of a complex\n\
  *  Hermitian packed matrix A using the factorization A = U*D*U**H or\n\
  *  A = L*D*L**H computed by CHPTRF.\n\
  *\n\
  *  An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the\n\
  *  condition number is computed as RCOND = 1 / (ANORM * norm(inv(A))).\n\
  *\n\n\
  *  Arguments\n\
  *  =========\n\
  *\n\
  *  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1\n\
  *          Specifies whether the details of the factorization are stored\n\
  *          as an upper or lower triangular matrix.\n\
  *          = 'U':  Upper triangular, form is A = U*D*U**H;\n\
  *          = 'L':  Lower triangular, form is A = L*D*L**H.\n\
  *\n\
  *  N       (input) INTEGER\n\
  *          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.\n\
  *\n\
  *  AP      (input) COMPLEX array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)\n\
  *          The block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used to\n\
  *          obtain the factor U or L as computed by CHPTRF, stored as a\n\
  *          packed triangular matrix.\n\
  *\n\
  *  IPIV    (input) INTEGER array, dimension (N)\n\
  *          Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D\n\
  *          as determined by CHPTRF.\n\
  *\n\
  *  ANORM   (input) REAL\n\
  *          The 1-norm of the original matrix A.\n\
  *\n\
  *  RCOND   (output) REAL\n\
  *          The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A,\n\
  *          computed as RCOND = 1/(ANORM * AINVNM), where AINVNM is an\n\
  *          estimate of the 1-norm of inv(A) computed in this routine.\n\
  *\n\
  *  WORK    (workspace) COMPLEX array, dimension (2*N)\n\
  *\n\
  *  INFO    (output) INTEGER\n\
  *          = 0:  successful exit\n\
  *          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value\n\
