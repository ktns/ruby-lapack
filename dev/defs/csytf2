:fortran_help: "      SUBROUTINE CSYTF2( UPLO, N, A, LDA, IPIV, INFO )\n\n\
  *  Purpose\n\
  *  =======\n\
  *\n\
  *  CSYTF2 computes the factorization of a complex symmetric matrix A\n\
  *  using the Bunch-Kaufman diagonal pivoting method:\n\
  *\n\
  *     A = U*D*U'  or  A = L*D*L'\n\
  *\n\
  *  where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)\n\
  *  triangular matrices, U' is the transpose of U, and D is symmetric and\n\
  *  block diagonal with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.\n\
  *\n\
  *  This is the unblocked version of the algorithm, calling Level 2 BLAS.\n\
  *\n\n\
  *  Arguments\n\
  *  =========\n\
  *\n\
  *  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1\n\
  *          Specifies whether the upper or lower triangular part of the\n\
  *          symmetric matrix A is stored:\n\
  *          = 'U':  Upper triangular\n\
  *          = 'L':  Lower triangular\n\
  *\n\
  *  N       (input) INTEGER\n\
  *          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.\n\
  *\n\
  *  A       (input/output) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA,N)\n\
  *          On entry, the symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading\n\
  *          n-by-n upper triangular part of A contains the upper\n\
  *          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower\n\
  *          triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the\n\
  *          leading n-by-n lower triangular part of A contains the lower\n\
  *          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper\n\
  *          triangular part of A is not referenced.\n\
  *\n\
  *          On exit, the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used\n\
  *          to obtain the factor U or L (see below for further details).\n\
  *\n\
  *  LDA     (input) INTEGER\n\
  *          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).\n\
  *\n\
  *  IPIV    (output) INTEGER array, dimension (N)\n\
  *          Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D.\n\
  *          If IPIV(k) > 0, then rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were\n\
  *          interchanged and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.\n\
  *          If UPLO = 'U' and IPIV(k) = IPIV(k-1) < 0, then rows and\n\
  *          columns k-1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k-1:k,k-1:k)\n\
  *          is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'L' and IPIV(k) =\n\
  *          IPIV(k+1) < 0, then rows and columns k+1 and -IPIV(k) were\n\
  *          interchanged and D(k:k+1,k:k+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.\n\
  *\n\
  *  INFO    (output) INTEGER\n\
  *          = 0: successful exit\n\
  *          < 0: if INFO = -k, the k-th argument had an illegal value\n\
  *          > 0: if INFO = k, D(k,k) is exactly zero.  The factorization\n\
  *               has been completed, but the block diagonal matrix D is\n\
  *               exactly singular, and division by zero will occur if it\n\
  *               is used to solve a system of equations.\n\

  *  If s = 1, D(k) overwrites A(k,k), and v overwrites A(k+1:n,k).\n\
