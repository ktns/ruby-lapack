  *  Purpose\n\
  *  =======\n\
  *\n\
  *  CGBSVX uses the LU factorization to compute the solution to a complex\n\
  *  system of linear equations A * X = B, A**T * X = B, or A**H * X = B,\n\
  *  where A is a band matrix of order N with KL subdiagonals and KU\n\
  *  superdiagonals, and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.\n\
  *\n\
  *  Error bounds on the solution and a condition estimate are also\n\
  *  provided.\n\
  *\n\
  *  Description\n\
  *  ===========\n\
  *\n\
  *  The following steps are performed by this subroutine:\n\
  *\n\
  *  1. If FACT = 'E', real scaling factors are computed to equilibrate\n\
  *     the system:\n\
  *        TRANS = 'N':  diag(R)*A*diag(C)     *inv(diag(C))*X = diag(R)*B\n\
  *        TRANS = 'T': (diag(R)*A*diag(C))**T *inv(diag(R))*X = diag(C)*B\n\
  *        TRANS = 'C': (diag(R)*A*diag(C))**H *inv(diag(R))*X = diag(C)*B\n\
  *     Whether or not the system will be equilibrated depends on the\n\
  *     scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, A is\n\
  *     overwritten by diag(R)*A*diag(C) and B by diag(R)*B (if TRANS='N')\n\
  *     or diag(C)*B (if TRANS = 'T' or 'C').\n\
  *\n\
  *  2. If FACT = 'N' or 'E', the LU decomposition is used to factor the\n\
  *     matrix A (after equilibration if FACT = 'E') as\n\
  *        A = L * U,\n\
  *     where L is a product of permutation and unit lower triangular\n\
  *     matrices with KL subdiagonals, and U is upper triangular with\n\
  *     KL+KU superdiagonals.\n\
  *\n\
  *  3. If some U(i,i)=0, so that U is exactly singular, then the routine\n\
  *     returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored form of A is used\n\
  *     to estimate the condition number of the matrix A.  If the\n\
  *     reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine precision,\n\
  *     INFO = N+1 is returned as a warning, but the routine still goes on\n\
  *     to solve for X and compute error bounds as described below.\n\
  *\n\
  *  4. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form\n\
  *     of A.\n\
  *\n\
  *  5. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution\n\
  *     matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates\n\
  *     for it.\n\
  *\n\
  *  6. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by\n\
  *     diag(C) (if TRANS = 'N') or diag(R) (if TRANS = 'T' or 'C') so\n\
  *     that it solves the original system before equilibration.\n\
  *\n\n\
  *  Arguments\n\
  *  =========\n\
  *\n\
  *  FACT    (input) CHARACTER*1\n\
  *          Specifies whether or not the factored form of the matrix A is\n\
  *          supplied on entry, and if not, whether the matrix A should be\n\
  *          equilibrated before it is factored.\n\
  *          = 'F':  On entry, AFB and IPIV contain the factored form of\n\
  *                  A.  If EQUED is not 'N', the matrix A has been\n\

  *          AB(KU+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-KU)<=i<=min(N,j+kl)\n\
  *\n\
  *          If FACT = 'F' and EQUED is not 'N', then A must have been\n\
  *          equilibrated by the scaling factors in R and/or C.  AB is not\n\
  *          modified if FACT = 'F' or 'N', or if FACT = 'E' and\n\
  *          EQUED = 'N' on exit.\n\
  *\n\
  *          On exit, if EQUED .ne. 'N', A is scaled as follows:\n\

  *          If FACT = 'F', then AFB is an input argument and on entry\n\

  *          band matrix with KL+KU superdiagonals in rows 1 to KL+KU+1,\n\
  *          and the multipliers used during the factorization are stored\n\
  *          in rows KL+KU+2 to 2*KL+KU+1.  If EQUED .ne. 'N', then AFB is\n\
  *          the factored form of the equilibrated matrix A.\n\

  *          = 'N':  No equilibration (always true if FACT = 'N').\n\
  *          = 'R':  Row equilibration, i.e., A has been premultiplied by\n\
  *                  diag(R).\n\

  *  RCOND   (output) REAL\n\
  *          The estimate of the reciprocal condition number of the matrix\n\
  *          A after equilibration (if done).  If RCOND is less than the\n\
  *          machine precision (in particular, if RCOND = 0), the matrix\n\
  *          is singular to working precision.  This condition is\n\
  *          indicated by a return code of INFO > 0.\n\
  *\n\
  *  FERR    (output) REAL array, dimension (NRHS)\n\
  *          The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector\n\
  *          X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).\n\
  *          If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)\n\
  *          is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest\n\
  *          element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the\n\
  *          largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as\n\

  *          overestimate of the true error.\n\
  *\n\
  *  BERR    (output) REAL array, dimension (NRHS)\n\
  *          The componentwise relative backward error of each solution\n\
  *          vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in\n\
  *          any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).\n\
  *\n\

  *\n\
  *  RWORK   (workspace/output) REAL array, dimension (N)\n\
  *          On exit, RWORK(1) contains the reciprocal pivot growth\n\
  *          factor norm(A)/norm(U). The \"max absolute element\" norm is\n\
  *          used. If RWORK(1) is much less than 1, then the stability\n\
  *          of the LU factorization of the (equilibrated) matrix A\n\
  *          could be poor. This also means that the solution X, condition\n\
  *          estimator RCOND, and forward error bound FERR could be\n\
  *          unreliable. If factorization fails with 0<INFO<=N, then\n\
  *          RWORK(1) contains the reciprocal pivot growth factor for the\n\
  *          leading INFO columns of A.\n\
  *\n\
  *  INFO    (output) INTEGER\n\
  *          = 0:  successful exit\n\
  *          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value\n\
  *          > 0:  if INFO = i, and i is\n\
  *                <= N:  U(i,i) is exactly zero.  The factorization\n\
  *                       has been completed, but the factor U is exactly\n\
  *                       singular, so the solution and error bounds\n\
  *                       could not be computed. RCOND = 0 is returned.\n\
  *                = N+1: U is nonsingular, but RCOND is less than machine\n\
  *                       precision, meaning that the matrix is singular\n\
  *                       to working precision.  Nevertheless, the\n\
  *                       solution and error bounds are computed because\n\
  *                       there are a number of situations where the\n\
  *                       computed solution can be more accurate than the\n\
  *                       value of RCOND would suggest.\n\
