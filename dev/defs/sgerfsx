:fortran_help: "      SUBROUTINE SGERFSX( TRANS, EQUED, N, NRHS, A, LDA, AF, LDAF, IPIV, R, C, B, LDB, X, LDX, RCOND, BERR, N_ERR_BNDS, ERR_BNDS_NORM, ERR_BNDS_COMP, NPARAMS, PARAMS, WORK, IWORK, INFO )\n\n\
  *     Purpose\n\
  *     =======\n\
  *\n\
  *     SGERFSX improves the computed solution to a system of linear\n\
  *     equations and provides error bounds and backward error estimates\n\
  *     for the solution.  In addition to normwise error bound, the code\n\
  *     provides maximum componentwise error bound if possible.  See\n\
  *     comments for ERR_BNDS_NORM and ERR_BNDS_COMP for details of the\n\
  *     error bounds.\n\
  *\n\
  *     The original system of linear equations may have been equilibrated\n\
  *     before calling this routine, as described by arguments EQUED, R\n\
  *     and C below. In this case, the solution and error bounds returned\n\
  *     are for the original unequilibrated system.\n\
  *\n\n\
  *     Arguments\n\
  *     =========\n\
  *\n\
  *     Some optional parameters are bundled in the PARAMS array.  These\n\
  *     settings determine how refinement is performed, but often the\n\
  *     defaults are acceptable.  If the defaults are acceptable, users\n\
  *     can pass NPARAMS = 0 which prevents the source code from accessing\n\
  *     the PARAMS argument.\n\
  *\n\
  *     TRANS   (input) CHARACTER*1\n\
  *     Specifies the form of the system of equations:\n\
  *       = 'N':  A * X = B     (No transpose)\n\
  *       = 'T':  A**T * X = B  (Transpose)\n\
  *       = 'C':  A**H * X = B  (Conjugate transpose = Transpose)\n\
  *\n\
  *     EQUED   (input) CHARACTER*1\n\
  *     Specifies the form of equilibration that was done to A\n\
  *     before calling this routine. This is needed to compute\n\
  *     the solution and error bounds correctly.\n\
  *       = 'N':  No equilibration\n\
  *       = 'R':  Row equilibration, i.e., A has been premultiplied by\n\
  *               diag(R).\n\
  *       = 'C':  Column equilibration, i.e., A has been postmultiplied\n\
  *               by diag(C).\n\
  *       = 'B':  Both row and column equilibration, i.e., A has been\n\
  *               replaced by diag(R) * A * diag(C).\n\
  *               The right hand side B has been changed accordingly.\n\
  *\n\
  *     N       (input) INTEGER\n\
  *     The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.\n\
  *\n\
  *     NRHS    (input) INTEGER\n\
  *     The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns\n\
  *     of the matrices B and X.  NRHS >= 0.\n\
  *\n\
  *     A       (input) REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)\n\
  *     The original N-by-N matrix A.\n\
  *\n\
  *     LDA     (input) INTEGER\n\
  *     The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).\n\
  *\n\
  *     AF      (input) REAL array, dimension (LDAF,N)\n\
  *     The factors L and U from the factorization A = P*L*U\n\
  *     as computed by SGETRF.\n\
  *\n\
  *     LDAF    (input) INTEGER\n\
  *     The leading dimension of the array AF.  LDAF >= max(1,N).\n\
  *\n\
  *     IPIV    (input) INTEGER array, dimension (N)\n\
  *     The pivot indices from SGETRF; for 1<=i<=N, row i of the\n\
  *     matrix was interchanged with row IPIV(i).\n\
  *\n\
  *     R       (input) REAL array, dimension (N)\n\
  *     The row scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'R' or 'B', A is\n\
  *     multiplied on the left by diag(R); if EQUED = 'N' or 'C', R\n\
  *     is not accessed.  \n\
  *     If R is accessed, each element of R should be a power of the radix\n\
  *     to ensure a reliable solution and error estimates. Scaling by\n\
  *     powers of the radix does not cause rounding errors unless the\n\
  *     result underflows or overflows. Rounding errors during scaling\n\
  *     lead to refining with a matrix that is not equivalent to the\n\
  *     input matrix, producing error estimates that may not be\n\
  *     reliable.\n\
  *\n\
  *     C       (input) REAL array, dimension (N)\n\
  *     The column scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'C' or 'B', A is\n\
  *     multiplied on the right by diag(C); if EQUED = 'N' or 'R', C\n\
  *     is not accessed. \n\
  *     If C is accessed, each element of C should be a power of the radix\n\
  *     to ensure a reliable solution and error estimates. Scaling by\n\
  *     powers of the radix does not cause rounding errors unless the\n\
  *     result underflows or overflows. Rounding errors during scaling\n\
  *     lead to refining with a matrix that is not equivalent to the\n\
  *     input matrix, producing error estimates that may not be\n\
  *     reliable.\n\
  *\n\
  *     B       (input) REAL array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)\n\
  *     The right hand side matrix B.\n\
  *\n\
  *     LDB     (input) INTEGER\n\
  *     The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).\n\
  *\n\
  *     X       (input/output) REAL array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)\n\
  *     On entry, the solution matrix X, as computed by SGETRS.\n\
  *     On exit, the improved solution matrix X.\n\
  *\n\
  *     LDX     (input) INTEGER\n\
  *     The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).\n\
  *\n\
  *     RCOND   (output) REAL\n\
  *     Reciprocal scaled condition number.  This is an estimate of the\n\
  *     reciprocal Skeel condition number of the matrix A after\n\
  *     equilibration (if done).  If this is less than the machine\n\
  *     precision (in particular, if it is zero), the matrix is singular\n\
  *     to working precision.  Note that the error may still be small even\n\
  *     if this number is very small and the matrix appears ill-\n\
  *     conditioned.\n\
  *\n\
  *     BERR    (output) REAL array, dimension (NRHS)\n\
  *     Componentwise relative backward error.  This is the\n\
  *     componentwise relative backward error of each solution vector X(j)\n\
  *     (i.e., the smallest relative change in any element of A or B that\n\
  *     makes X(j) an exact solution).\n\
  *\n\
  *     N_ERR_BNDS (input) INTEGER\n\
  *     Number of error bounds to return for each right hand side\n\
  *     and each type (normwise or componentwise).  See ERR_BNDS_NORM and\n\
  *     ERR_BNDS_COMP below.\n\
  *\n\
  *     ERR_BNDS_NORM  (output) REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)\n\
  *     For each right-hand side, this array contains information about\n\
  *     various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the\n\
  *     normwise relative error, which is defined as follows:\n\
  *\n\
  *     Normwise relative error in the ith solution vector:\n\
  *             max_j (abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i)))\n\
  *            ------------------------------\n\
  *                  max_j abs(X(j,i))\n\
  *\n\
  *     The array is indexed by the type of error information as described\n\
  *     below. There currently are up to three pieces of information\n\
  *     returned.\n\
  *\n\
  *     The first index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(i,:) corresponds to the ith\n\
  *     right-hand side.\n\
  *\n\
  *     The second index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,err) contains the following\n\
  *     three fields:\n\
  *     err = 1 \"Trust/don't trust\" boolean. Trust the answer if the\n\
  *              reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold\n\
  *              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').\n\
  *\n\
  *     err = 2 \"Guaranteed\" error bound: The estimated forward error,\n\
  *              almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error\n\
  *              so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold\n\
  *              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only\n\
  *              be trusted if the previous boolean is true.\n\
  *\n\
  *     err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated normwise\n\
  *              reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold\n\
  *              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error\n\
  *              estimate is \"guaranteed\". These reciprocal condition\n\
  *              numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some\n\
  *              appropriately scaled matrix Z.\n\
  *              Let Z = S*A, where S scales each row by a power of the\n\
  *              radix so all absolute row sums of Z are approximately 1.\n\
  *\n\
  *     See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra\n\
  *     cautions.\n\
  *\n\
  *     ERR_BNDS_COMP  (output) REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)\n\
  *     For each right-hand side, this array contains information about\n\
  *     various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the\n\

  *                         abs(X(j,i))\n\
  *\n\
  *     The array is indexed by the right-hand side i (on which the\n\
  *     componentwise relative error depends), and the type of error\n\
  *     information as described below. There currently are up to three\n\
  *     pieces of information returned for each right-hand side. If\n\
  *     componentwise accuracy is not requested (PARAMS(3) = 0.0), then\n\
  *     ERR_BNDS_COMP is not accessed.  If N_ERR_BNDS .LT. 3, then at most\n\
  *     the first (:,N_ERR_BNDS) entries are returned.\n\
  *\n\
  *     The first index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(i,:) corresponds to the ith\n\
  *     right-hand side.\n\
  *\n\
  *     The second index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,err) contains the following\n\
  *     three fields:\n\
  *     err = 1 \"Trust/don't trust\" boolean. Trust the answer if the\n\

  *              appropriately scaled matrix Z.\n\
  *              Let Z = S*(A*diag(x)), where x is the solution for the\n\
  *              current right-hand side and S scales each row of\n\
  *              A*diag(x) by a power of the radix so all absolute row\n\

  *\n\
  *     NPARAMS (input) INTEGER\n\

  *     PARAMS array is never referenced and default values are used.\n\
  *\n\
  *     PARAMS  (input / output) REAL array, dimension NPARAMS\n\

  *     that entry will be filled with default value used for that\n\
  *     parameter.  Only positions up to NPARAMS are accessed; defaults\n\
