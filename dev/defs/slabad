:fortran_help: "      SUBROUTINE SLABAD( SMALL, LARGE )\n\n\
  *  Purpose\n\
  *  =======\n\
  *\n\
  *  SLABAD takes as input the values computed by SLAMCH for underflow and\n\
  *  overflow, and returns the square root of each of these values if the\n\
  *  log of LARGE is sufficiently large.  This subroutine is intended to\n\
  *  identify machines with a large exponent range, such as the Crays, and\n\
  *  redefine the underflow and overflow limits to be the square roots of\n\
  *  the values computed by SLAMCH.  This subroutine is needed because\n\
  *  SLAMCH does not compensate for poor arithmetic in the upper half of\n\
  *  the exponent range, as is found on a Cray.\n\
  *\n\n\
  *  Arguments\n\
  *  =========\n\
  *\n\
  *  SMALL   (input/output) REAL\n\
  *          On entry, the underflow threshold as computed by SLAMCH.\n\
  *          On exit, if LOG10(LARGE) is sufficiently large, the square\n\
  *          root of SMALL, otherwise unchanged.\n\
  *\n\
  *  LARGE   (input/output) REAL\n\
  *          On entry, the overflow threshold as computed by SLAMCH.\n\
  *          On exit, if LOG10(LARGE) is sufficiently large, the square\n\
  *          root of LARGE, otherwise unchanged.\n\
