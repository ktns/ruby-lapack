:fortran_help: "      SUBROUTINE SLATDF( IJOB, N, Z, LDZ, RHS, RDSUM, RDSCAL, IPIV, JPIV )\n\n\
  *  Purpose\n\
  *  =======\n\
  *\n\
  *  SLATDF uses the LU factorization of the n-by-n matrix Z computed by\n\
  *  SGETC2 and computes a contribution to the reciprocal Dif-estimate\n\
  *  by solving Z * x = b for x, and choosing the r.h.s. b such that\n\
  *  the norm of x is as large as possible. On entry RHS = b holds the\n\
  *  contribution from earlier solved sub-systems, and on return RHS = x.\n\
  *\n\
  *  The factorization of Z returned by SGETC2 has the form Z = P*L*U*Q,\n\
  *  where P and Q are permutation matrices. L is lower triangular with\n\
  *  unit diagonal elements and U is upper triangular.\n\
  *\n\n\
  *  Arguments\n\
  *  =========\n\
  *\n\
  *  IJOB    (input) INTEGER\n\
  *          IJOB = 2: First compute an approximative null-vector e\n\
  *              of Z using SGECON, e is normalized and solve for\n\
  *              Zx = +-e - f with the sign giving the greater value\n\
  *              of 2-norm(x). About 5 times as expensive as Default.\n\
  *          IJOB .ne. 2: Local look ahead strategy where all entries of\n\
  *              the r.h.s. b is choosen as either +1 or -1 (Default).\n\
  *\n\
  *  N       (input) INTEGER\n\
  *          The number of columns of the matrix Z.\n\
  *\n\
  *  Z       (input) REAL array, dimension (LDZ, N)\n\
  *          On entry, the LU part of the factorization of the n-by-n\n\
  *          matrix Z computed by SGETC2:  Z = P * L * U * Q\n\
  *\n\
  *  LDZ     (input) INTEGER\n\
  *          The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDA >= max(1, N).\n\
  *\n\
  *  RHS     (input/output) REAL array, dimension N.\n\
  *          On entry, RHS contains contributions from other subsystems.\n\
  *          On exit, RHS contains the solution of the subsystem with\n\
  *          entries acoording to the value of IJOB (see above).\n\
  *\n\
  *  RDSUM   (input/output) REAL\n\
  *          On entry, the sum of squares of computed contributions to\n\
  *          the Dif-estimate under computation by STGSYL, where the\n\
  *          scaling factor RDSCAL (see below) has been factored out.\n\
  *          On exit, the corresponding sum of squares updated with the\n\
  *          contributions from the current sub-system.\n\
  *          If TRANS = 'T' RDSUM is not touched.\n\
  *          NOTE: RDSUM only makes sense when STGSY2 is called by STGSYL.\n\
  *\n\
  *  RDSCAL  (input/output) REAL\n\
  *          On entry, scaling factor used to prevent overflow in RDSUM.\n\
  *          On exit, RDSCAL is updated w.r.t. the current contributions\n\
  *          in RDSUM.\n\
  *          If TRANS = 'T', RDSCAL is not touched.\n\
  *          NOTE: RDSCAL only makes sense when STGSY2 is called by\n\
  *                STGSYL.\n\
  *\n\
  *  IPIV    (input) INTEGER array, dimension (N).\n\
  *          The pivot indices; for 1 <= i <= N, row i of the\n\
  *          matrix has been interchanged with row IPIV(i).\n\
  *\n\
  *  JPIV    (input) INTEGER array, dimension (N).\n\
  *          The pivot indices; for 1 <= j <= N, column j of the\n\
  *          matrix has been interchanged with column JPIV(j).\n\
