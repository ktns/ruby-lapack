      SUBROUTINE DPPCON( UPLO, N, AP, ANORM, RCOND, WORK, IWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DPPCON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number (in the
*  1-norm) of a real symmetric positive definite packed matrix using
*  the Cholesky factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T computed by
*  DPPTRF.
*
*  An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the
*  condition number is computed as RCOND = 1 / (ANORM * norm(inv(A))).
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
*          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER

*          A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T, packed columnwise in a linear
*          array.  The j-th column of U or L is stored in the array AP
*          as follows:
*          if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = U(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
*          if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2n-j)/2) = L(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
*

*          The 1-norm (or infinity-norm) of the symmetric matrix A.
*
*  RCOND   (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A,
*          computed as RCOND = 1/(ANORM * AINVNM), where AINVNM is an
*          estimate of the 1-norm of inv(A) computed in this routine.
*
*  WORK    (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (3*N)
*
*  IWORK   (workspace) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE DPPEQU( UPLO, N, AP, S, SCOND, AMAX, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DPPEQU computes row and column scalings intended to equilibrate a
*  symmetric positive definite matrix A in packed storage and reduce
*  its condition number (with respect to the two-norm).  S contains the
*  scale factors, S(i)=1/sqrt(A(i,i)), chosen so that the scaled matrix
*  B with elements B(i,j)=S(i)*A(i,j)*S(j) has ones on the diagonal.
*  This choice of S puts the condition number of B within a factor N of
*  the smallest possible condition number over all possible diagonal
*  scalings.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
*          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.

*          The upper or lower triangle of the symmetric matrix A, packed
*          columnwise in a linear array.  The j-th column of A is stored
*          in the array AP as follows:
*          if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
*          if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
*

*          If INFO = 0, S contains the scale factors for A.
*
*  SCOND   (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          If INFO = 0, S contains the ratio of the smallest S(i) to
*          the largest S(i).  If SCOND >= 0.1 and AMAX is neither too
*          large nor too small, it is not worth scaling by S.
*
*  AMAX    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          Absolute value of largest matrix element.  If AMAX is very
*          close to overflow or very close to underflow, the matrix
*          should be scaled.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DPPSV computes the solution to a real system of linear equations
*     A * X = B,
*  where A is an N-by-N symmetric positive definite matrix stored in

*     A = L * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
*  where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is a lower triangular
*  matrix.  The factored form of A is then used to solve the system of
*  equations A * X = B.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1

*                completed, and the solution has not been computed.
*

*  Further Details
*  ===============
*
*  The packed storage scheme is illustrated by the following example
*  when N = 4, UPLO = 'U':
*
*  Two-dimensional storage of the symmetric matrix A:
*
*     a11 a12 a13 a14

*             a33 a34     (aij = conjg(aji))
*                 a44
*
*  Packed storage of the upper triangle of A:

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE DPPSVX( FACT, UPLO, N, NRHS, AP, AFP, EQUED, S, B, LDB, X, LDX, RCOND, FERR, BERR, WORK, IWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DPPSVX uses the Cholesky factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T to
*  compute the solution to a real system of linear equations
*     A * X = B,
*  where A is an N-by-N symmetric positive definite matrix stored in
*  packed format and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.
*
*  Error bounds on the solution and a condition estimate are also
*  provided.
*
*  Description
*  ===========
*
*  The following steps are performed:
*
*  1. If FACT = 'E', real scaling factors are computed to equilibrate
*     the system:
*        diag(S) * A * diag(S) * inv(diag(S)) * X = diag(S) * B
*     Whether or not the system will be equilibrated depends on the
*     scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, A is
*     overwritten by diag(S)*A*diag(S) and B by diag(S)*B.
*
*  2. If FACT = 'N' or 'E', the Cholesky decomposition is used to
*     factor the matrix A (after equilibration if FACT = 'E') as
*        A = U**T* U,  if UPLO = 'U', or
*        A = L * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
*     where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is a lower triangular
*     matrix.
*
*  3. If the leading i-by-i principal minor is not positive definite,
*     then the routine returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored
*     form of A is used to estimate the condition number of the matrix
*     A.  If the reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine
*     precision, INFO = N+1 is returned as a warning, but the routine
*     still goes on to solve for X and compute error bounds as
*     described below.
*
*  4. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
*     of A.
*
*  5. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution
*     matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates
*     for it.
*
*  6. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by
*     diag(S) so that it solves the original system before
*     equilibration.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  FACT    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies whether or not the factored form of the matrix A is
*          supplied on entry, and if not, whether the matrix A should be
*          equilibrated before it is factored.
*          = 'F':  On entry, AFP contains the factored form of A.
*                  If EQUED = 'Y', the matrix A has been equilibrated

*                  be modified.
*          = 'N':  The matrix A will be copied to AFP and factored.
*          = 'E':  The matrix A will be equilibrated if necessary, then

*          diag(S)*A*diag(S).  The j-th column of A is stored in the
*          array AP as follows:
*          if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
*          if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
*          See below for further details.  A is not modified if
*          FACT = 'F' or 'N', or if FACT = 'E' and EQUED = 'N' on exit.

*          factorization A = U'*U or A = L*L', in the same storage
*          format as A.  If EQUED .ne. 'N', then AFP is the factored
*          form of the equilibrated matrix A.
*
*          If FACT = 'N', then AFP is an output argument and on exit
*          returns the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky
*          factorization A = U'*U or A = L*L' of the original matrix A.
*
*          If FACT = 'E', then AFP is an output argument and on exit
*          returns the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky
*          factorization A = U'*U or A = L*L' of the equilibrated
*          matrix A (see the description of AP for the form of the
*          equilibrated matrix).

*                  diag(S) * A * diag(S).
*          EQUED is an input argument if FACT = 'F'; otherwise, it is an

*

*          The scale factors for A; not accessed if EQUED = 'N'.  S is
*          an input argument if FACT = 'F'; otherwise, S is an output
*          argument.  If FACT = 'F' and EQUED = 'Y', each element of S

*
*  RCOND   (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The estimate of the reciprocal condition number of the matrix
