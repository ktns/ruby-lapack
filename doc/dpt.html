*
*  ANORM   (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The 1-norm of the original matrix A.
*
*  RCOND   (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A,

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE DPTEQR( COMPZ, N, D, E, Z, LDZ, WORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DPTEQR computes all eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors of a
*  symmetric positive definite tridiagonal matrix by first factoring the
*  matrix using DPTTRF, and then calling DBDSQR to compute the singular
*  values of the bidiagonal factor.
*
*  This routine computes the eigenvalues of the positive definite
*  tridiagonal matrix to high relative accuracy.  This means that if the
*  eigenvalues range over many orders of magnitude in size, then the
*  small eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors will be computed
*  more accurately than, for example, with the standard QR method.
*
*  The eigenvectors of a full or band symmetric positive definite matrix
*  can also be found if DSYTRD, DSPTRD, or DSBTRD has been used to
*  reduce this matrix to tridiagonal form. (The reduction to tridiagonal
*  form, however, may preclude the possibility of obtaining high
*  relative accuracy in the small eigenvalues of the original matrix, if
*  these eigenvalues range over many orders of magnitude.)
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  COMPZ   (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'N':  Compute eigenvalues only.
*          = 'V':  Compute eigenvectors of original symmetric
*                  matrix also.  Array Z contains the orthogonal
*                  matrix used to reduce the original matrix to
*                  tridiagonal form.
*          = 'I':  Compute eigenvectors of tridiagonal matrix also.

*          The order of the matrix.  N >= 0.
*
*  D       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          On entry, the n diagonal elements of the tridiagonal
*          matrix.
*          On normal exit, D contains the eigenvalues, in descending
*          order.
*
*  E       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1)
*          On entry, the (n-1) subdiagonal elements of the tridiagonal
*          matrix.

*          original symmetric matrix;
*          if COMPZ = 'I', the orthonormal eigenvectors of the
*          tridiagonal matrix.
*          If INFO > 0 on exit, Z contains the eigenvectors associated
*          with only the stored eigenvalues.
*          If  COMPZ = 'N', then Z is not referenced.
*
*  LDZ     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDZ >= 1, and if
*          COMPZ = 'V' or 'I', LDZ >= max(1,N).
*
*  WORK    (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (4*N)
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit.
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
*          > 0:  if INFO = i, and i is:
*                <= N  the Cholesky factorization of the matrix could
*                      not be performed because the i-th principal minor
*                      was not positive definite.
*                > N   the SVD algorithm failed to converge;

  Solves a symmetric positive definite tridiagonal

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE DPTSVX( FACT, N, NRHS, D, E, DF, EF, B, LDB, X, LDX, RCOND, FERR, BERR, WORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DPTSVX uses the factorization A = L*D*L**T to compute the solution
*  to a real system of linear equations A*X = B, where A is an N-by-N
*  symmetric positive definite tridiagonal matrix and X and B are
*  N-by-NRHS matrices.
*
*  Error bounds on the solution and a condition estimate are also
*  provided.
*
*  Description
*  ===========
*
*  The following steps are performed:
*
*  1. If FACT = 'N', the matrix A is factored as A = L*D*L**T, where L
*     is a unit lower bidiagonal matrix and D is diagonal.  The
*     factorization can also be regarded as having the form
*     A = U**T*D*U.
*
*  2. If the leading i-by-i principal minor is not positive definite,
*     then the routine returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored
*     form of A is used to estimate the condition number of the matrix
*     A.  If the reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine
*     precision, INFO = N+1 is returned as a warning, but the routine
*     still goes on to solve for X and compute error bounds as
*     described below.
*
*  3. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
*     of A.
*
*  4. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution
*     matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates
*     for it.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  FACT    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies whether or not the factored form of A has been
*          supplied on entry.
*          = 'F':  On entry, DF and EF contain the factored form of A.
*                  D, E, DF, and EF will not be modified.
*          = 'N':  The matrix A will be copied to DF and EF and
*                  factored.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  NRHS    (input) INTEGER
*          The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
*          of the matrices B and X.  NRHS >= 0.
*
*  D       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          The n diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix A.
*
*  E       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1)
*          The (n-1) subdiagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix A.
*
*  DF      (input or output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          If FACT = 'F', then DF is an input argument and on entry
*          contains the n diagonal elements of the diagonal matrix D
*          from the L*D*L**T factorization of A.
*          If FACT = 'N', then DF is an output argument and on exit
*          contains the n diagonal elements of the diagonal matrix D
*          from the L*D*L**T factorization of A.
*
*  EF      (input or output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1)
*          If FACT = 'F', then EF is an input argument and on entry
*          contains the (n-1) subdiagonal elements of the unit
*          bidiagonal factor L from the L*D*L**T factorization of A.
*          If FACT = 'N', then EF is an output argument and on exit
*          contains the (n-1) subdiagonal elements of the unit
*          bidiagonal factor L from the L*D*L**T factorization of A.
*
*  B       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
*          The N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.
*
*  LDB     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
*

*
*  LDX     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
*
*  RCOND   (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The reciprocal condition number of the matrix A.  If RCOND
*          is less than the machine precision (in particular, if
*          RCOND = 0), the matrix is singular to working precision.
*          This condition is indicated by a return code of INFO > 0.
*
*  FERR    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
*          The forward error bound for each solution vector
*          X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
*          If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
*          is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
*          element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
*          largest element in X(j).
*
*  BERR    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
*          The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
*          vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in any
*          element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).
*
*  WORK    (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (2*N)
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0:  if INFO = i, and i is
*                <= N:  the leading minor of order i of A is
*                       not positive definite, so the factorization
*                       could not be completed, and the solution has not
*                       been computed. RCOND = 0 is returned.
*                = N+1: U is nonsingular, but RCOND is less than machine
*                       precision, meaning that the matrix is singular
*                       to working precision.  Nevertheless, the
*                       solution and error bounds are computed because
*                       there are a number of situations where the
*                       computed solution can be more accurate than the
*                       value of RCOND would suggest.

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE DPTTRS( N, NRHS, D, E, B, LDB, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DPTTRS solves a tridiagonal system of the form
*     A * X = B
*  using the L*D*L' factorization of A computed by DPTTRF.  D is a
*  diagonal matrix specified in the vector D, L is a unit bidiagonal
*  matrix whose subdiagonal is specified in the vector E, and X and B
*  are N by NRHS matrices.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the tridiagonal matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  NRHS    (input) INTEGER
*          The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
*          of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.
*
*  D       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          The n diagonal elements of the diagonal matrix D from the
*          L*D*L' factorization of A.
*
*  E       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1)
*          The (n-1) subdiagonal elements of the unit bidiagonal factor
*          L from the L*D*L' factorization of A.  E can also be regarded
*          as the superdiagonal of the unit bidiagonal factor U from the
*          factorization A = U'*D*U.
*
*  B       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
*          On entry, the right hand side vectors B for the system of
*          linear equations.
*          On exit, the solution vectors, X.
*
*  LDB     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0: successful exit
*          < 0: if INFO = -k, the k-th argument had an illegal value
