*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  SGBEQU computes row and column scalings intended to equilibrate an
*  M-by-N band matrix A and reduce its condition number.  R returns the

*  make the largest element in each row and column of the matrix B with
*  elements B(i,j)=R(i)*A(i,j)*C(j) have absolute value 1.
*
*  R(i) and C(j) are restricted to be between SMLNUM = smallest safe
*  number and BIGNUM = largest safe number.  Use of these scaling
*  factors is not guaranteed to reduce the condition number of A but
*  works well in practice.

*          If INFO = 0, C contains the column scale factors for A.
*
*  ROWCND  (output) REAL
*          If INFO = 0 or INFO > M, ROWCND contains the ratio of the
*          smallest R(i) to the largest R(i).  If ROWCND >= 0.1 and

*          C(i) to the largest C(i).  If COLCND >= 0.1, it is not
*          worth scaling by C.
*
*  AMAX    (output) REAL
*          Absolute value of largest matrix element.  If AMAX is very
*          close to overflow or very close to underflow, the matrix
*          should be scaled.

*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0:  if INFO = i, and i is

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE SGBSVX( FACT, TRANS, N, KL, KU, NRHS, AB, LDAB, AFB, LDAFB, IPIV, EQUED, R, C, B, LDB, X, LDX, RCOND, FERR, BERR, WORK, IWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  SGBSVX uses the LU factorization to compute the solution to a real
*  system of linear equations A * X = B, A**T * X = B, or A**H * X = B,
*  where A is a band matrix of order N with KL subdiagonals and KU
*  superdiagonals, and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.
*
*  Error bounds on the solution and a condition estimate are also
*  provided.
*
*  Description
*  ===========
*
*  The following steps are performed by this subroutine:
*
*  1. If FACT = 'E', real scaling factors are computed to equilibrate
*     the system:
*        TRANS = 'N':  diag(R)*A*diag(C)     *inv(diag(C))*X = diag(R)*B
*        TRANS = 'T': (diag(R)*A*diag(C))**T *inv(diag(R))*X = diag(C)*B
*        TRANS = 'C': (diag(R)*A*diag(C))**H *inv(diag(R))*X = diag(C)*B
*     Whether or not the system will be equilibrated depends on the
*     scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, A is
*     overwritten by diag(R)*A*diag(C) and B by diag(R)*B (if TRANS='N')
*     or diag(C)*B (if TRANS = 'T' or 'C').
*
*  2. If FACT = 'N' or 'E', the LU decomposition is used to factor the
*     matrix A (after equilibration if FACT = 'E') as
*        A = L * U,
*     where L is a product of permutation and unit lower triangular
*     matrices with KL subdiagonals, and U is upper triangular with
*     KL+KU superdiagonals.
*
*  3. If some U(i,i)=0, so that U is exactly singular, then the routine
*     returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored form of A is used
*     to estimate the condition number of the matrix A.  If the
*     reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine precision,
*     INFO = N+1 is returned as a warning, but the routine still goes on
*     to solve for X and compute error bounds as described below.
*
*  4. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
*     of A.
*
*  5. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution
*     matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates
*     for it.
*
*  6. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by
*     diag(C) (if TRANS = 'N') or diag(R) (if TRANS = 'T' or 'C') so
*     that it solves the original system before equilibration.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  FACT    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies whether or not the factored form of the matrix A is
*          supplied on entry, and if not, whether the matrix A should be
*          equilibrated before it is factored.
*          = 'F':  On entry, AFB and IPIV contain the factored form of
*                  A.  If EQUED is not 'N', the matrix A has been
*                  equilibrated with scaling factors given by R and C.
*                  AB, AFB, and IPIV are not modified.
*          = 'N':  The matrix A will be copied to AFB and factored.
*          = 'E':  The matrix A will be equilibrated if necessary, then
*                  copied to AFB and factored.
*

*          On entry, the matrix A in band storage, in rows 1 to KL+KU+1.

*          AB(KU+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-KU)<=i<=min(N,j+kl)
*
*          If FACT = 'F' and EQUED is not 'N', then A must have been
*          equilibrated by the scaling factors in R and/or C.  AB is not
*          modified if FACT = 'F' or 'N', or if FACT = 'E' and
*          EQUED = 'N' on exit.
*
*          On exit, if EQUED .ne. 'N', A is scaled as follows:
*          EQUED = 'R':  A := diag(R) * A
*          EQUED = 'C':  A := A * diag(C)
*          EQUED = 'B':  A := diag(R) * A * diag(C).

*          and the multipliers used during the factorization are stored
*          in rows KL+KU+2 to 2*KL+KU+1.  If EQUED .ne. 'N', then AFB is

*          If FACT = 'E', then AFB is an output argument and on exit
*          returns details of the LU factorization of the equilibrated

*          of the equilibrated matrix A.
*
*  EQUED   (input or output) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies the form of equilibration that was done.
*          = 'N':  No equilibration (always true if FACT = 'N').
*          = 'R':  Row equilibration, i.e., A has been premultiplied by
*                  diag(R).
*          = 'C':  Column equilibration, i.e., A has been postmultiplied
*                  by diag(C).
*          = 'B':  Both row and column equilibration, i.e., A has been

*          EQUED is an input argument if FACT = 'F'; otherwise, it is an
*          output argument.
*
*  R       (input or output) REAL array, dimension (N)
*          The row scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'R' or 'B', A is
*          multiplied on the left by diag(R); if EQUED = 'N' or 'C', R
*          is not accessed.  R is an input argument if FACT = 'F';
*          otherwise, R is an output argument.  If FACT = 'F' and

*
*  C       (input or output) REAL array, dimension (N)
*          The column scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'C' or 'B', A is
*          multiplied on the right by diag(C); if EQUED = 'N' or 'R', C
*          is not accessed.  C is an input argument if FACT = 'F';

*          The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
*
*  X       (output) REAL array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
*          If INFO = 0 or INFO = N+1, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X
*          to the original system of equations.  Note that A and B are
*          modified on exit if EQUED .ne. 'N', and the solution to the
*          equilibrated system is inv(diag(C))*X if TRANS = 'N' and
*          EQUED = 'C' or 'B', or inv(diag(R))*X if TRANS = 'T' or 'C'
*          and EQUED = 'R' or 'B'.
*
*  LDX     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
*
*  RCOND   (output) REAL
*          The estimate of the reciprocal condition number of the matrix
*          A after equilibration (if done).  If RCOND is less than the
*          machine precision (in particular, if RCOND = 0), the matrix
*          is singular to working precision.  This condition is
*          indicated by a return code of INFO > 0.
*
*  FERR    (output) REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
*          The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
*          X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
*          If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
*          is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
*          element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
*          largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
*          the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight
*          overestimate of the true error.
*
*  BERR    (output) REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
*          The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
*          vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
*          any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).
*
*  WORK    (workspace/output) REAL array, dimension (3*N)
*          On exit, WORK(1) contains the reciprocal pivot growth
*          factor norm(A)/norm(U). The "max absolute element" norm is
*          used. If WORK(1) is much less than 1, then the stability
*          of the LU factorization of the (equilibrated) matrix A
*          could be poor. This also means that the solution X, condition
*          estimator RCOND, and forward error bound FERR could be
*          unreliable. If factorization fails with 0<INFO<=N, then
*          WORK(1) contains the reciprocal pivot growth factor for the
*          leading INFO columns of A.
*
*  IWORK   (workspace) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0:  if INFO = i, and i is
*                <= N:  U(i,i) is exactly zero.  The factorization
*                       has been completed, but the factor U is exactly
*                       singular, so the solution and error bounds
*                       could not be computed. RCOND = 0 is returned.
*                = N+1: U is nonsingular, but RCOND is less than machine
*                       precision, meaning that the matrix is singular
*                       to working precision.  Nevertheless, the
*                       solution and error bounds are computed because
*                       there are a number of situations where the
*                       computed solution can be more accurate than the
*
*                       value of RCOND would suggest.

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  SGBTF2 computes an LU factorization of a real m-by-n band matrix A
*  using partial pivoting with row interchanges.
*
*  This is the unblocked version of the algorithm, calling Level 2 BLAS.

*          The number of columns of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  KL      (input) INTEGER
*          The number of subdiagonals within the band of A.  KL >= 0.
*
*  KU      (input) INTEGER
*          The number of superdiagonals within the band of A.  KU >= 0.
*
*  AB      (input/output) REAL array, dimension (LDAB,N)
*          On entry, the matrix A in band storage, in rows KL+1 to
*          2*KL+KU+1; rows 1 to KL of the array need not be set.
*          The j-th column of A is stored in the j-th column of the
*          array AB as follows:
*          AB(kl+ku+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-ku)<=i<=min(m,j+kl)
*
*          On exit, details of the factorization: U is stored as an

*          rows 1 to KL+KU+1, and the multipliers used during the
*          factorization are stored in rows KL+KU+2 to 2*KL+KU+1.
*          See below for further details.

*
*  IPIV    (output) INTEGER array, dimension (min(M,N))
*          The pivot indices; for 1 <= i <= min(M,N), row i of the
*          matrix was interchanged with row IPIV(i).

*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0: successful exit
*          < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0: if INFO = +i, U(i,i) is exactly zero. The factorization
*               has been completed, but the factor U is exactly
*               singular, and division by zero will occur if it is used
*               to solve a system of equations.
*

*  Further Details
*  ===============
*
*  The band storage scheme is illustrated by the following example, when
*  M = N = 6, KL = 2, KU = 1:
*
*  On entry:                       On exit:

*
*  Array elements marked * are not used by the routine; elements marked

*
*      *    *    *    +    +    +       *    *    *   u14  u25  u36

*  Array elements marked * are not used by the routine; elements marked
*  + need not be set on entry, but are required by the routine to store
*  elements of U because of fill-in resulting from the row interchanges.

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE SGBTRS( TRANS, N, KL, KU, NRHS, AB, LDAB, IPIV, B, LDB, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  SGBTRS solves a system of linear equations
*     A * X = B  or  A' * X = B
*  with a general band matrix A using the LU factorization computed
*  by SGBTRF.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  TRANS   (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies the form of the system of equations.
*          = 'N':  A * X = B  (No transpose)
*          = 'T':  A'* X = B  (Transpose)
*          = 'C':  A'* X = B  (Conjugate transpose = Transpose)
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  KL      (input) INTEGER
*          The number of subdiagonals within the band of A.  KL >= 0.
*
*  KU      (input) INTEGER
*          The number of superdiagonals within the band of A.  KU >= 0.
*
*  NRHS    (input) INTEGER
*          The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
*          of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.
*
*  AB      (input) REAL array, dimension (LDAB,N)
*          Details of the LU factorization of the band matrix A, as
*          computed by SGBTRF.  U is stored as an upper triangular band
*          matrix with KL+KU superdiagonals in rows 1 to KL+KU+1, and
*          the multipliers used during the factorization are stored in
*          rows KL+KU+2 to 2*KL+KU+1.
*
*  LDAB    (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= 2*KL+KU+1.
*
*  IPIV    (input) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*          The pivot indices; for 1 <= i <= N, row i of the matrix was
*          interchanged with row IPIV(i).
*
*  B       (input/output) REAL array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
*          On entry, the right hand side matrix B.
*          On exit, the solution matrix X.
*
*  LDB     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
