FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE DGEESX( JOBVS, SORT, SELECT, SENSE, N, A, LDA, SDIM, WR, WI, VS, LDVS, RCONDE, RCONDV, WORK, LWORK, IWORK, LIWORK, BWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DGEESX computes for an N-by-N real nonsymmetric matrix A, the
*  eigenvalues, the real Schur form T, and, optionally, the matrix of
*  Schur vectors Z.  This gives the Schur factorization A = Z*T*(Z**T).
*
*  Optionally, it also orders the eigenvalues on the diagonal of the
*  real Schur form so that selected eigenvalues are at the top left;
*  computes a reciprocal condition number for the average of the
*  selected eigenvalues (RCONDE); and computes a reciprocal condition
*  number for the right invariant subspace corresponding to the
*  selected eigenvalues (RCONDV).  The leading columns of Z form an
*  orthonormal basis for this invariant subspace.
*
*  For further explanation of the reciprocal condition numbers RCONDE
*  and RCONDV, see Section 4.10 of the LAPACK Users' Guide (where
*  these quantities are called s and sep respectively).
*
*  A real matrix is in real Schur form if it is upper quasi-triangular
*  with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 blocks. 2-by-2 blocks will be standardized in
*  the form
*            [  a  b  ]
*            [  c  a  ]
*
*  where b*c < 0. The eigenvalues of such a block are a +- sqrt(bc).
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  JOBVS   (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'N': Schur vectors are not computed;
*          = 'V': Schur vectors are computed.
*
*  SORT    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies whether or not to order the eigenvalues on the
*          diagonal of the Schur form.
*          = 'N': Eigenvalues are not ordered;
*          = 'S': Eigenvalues are ordered (see SELECT).
*
*  SELECT  (external procedure) LOGICAL FUNCTION of two DOUBLE PRECISION arguments
*          SELECT must be declared EXTERNAL in the calling subroutine.
*          If SORT = 'S', SELECT is used to select eigenvalues to sort
*          to the top left of the Schur form.
*          If SORT = 'N', SELECT is not referenced.
*          An eigenvalue WR(j)+sqrt(-1)*WI(j) is selected if
*          SELECT(WR(j),WI(j)) is true; i.e., if either one of a
*          complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues is selected, then both
*          are.  Note that a selected complex eigenvalue may no longer
*          satisfy SELECT(WR(j),WI(j)) = .TRUE. after ordering, since
*          ordering may change the value of complex eigenvalues
*          (especially if the eigenvalue is ill-conditioned); in this
*          case INFO may be set to N+3 (see INFO below).
*
*  SENSE   (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Determines which reciprocal condition numbers are computed.
*          = 'N': None are computed;
*          = 'E': Computed for average of selected eigenvalues only;
*          = 'V': Computed for selected right invariant subspace only;
*          = 'B': Computed for both.
*          If SENSE = 'E', 'V' or 'B', SORT must equal 'S'.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A. N >= 0.
*
*  A       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA, N)
*          On entry, the N-by-N matrix A.
*          On exit, A is overwritten by its real Schur form T.
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
*
*  SDIM    (output) INTEGER
*          If SORT = 'N', SDIM = 0.
*          If SORT = 'S', SDIM = number of eigenvalues (after sorting)
*                         for which SELECT is true. (Complex conjugate
*                         pairs for which SELECT is true for either
*                         eigenvalue count as 2.)
*
*  WR      (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*  WI      (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          WR and WI contain the real and imaginary parts, respectively,
*          of the computed eigenvalues, in the same order that they
*          appear on the diagonal of the output Schur form T.  Complex
*          conjugate pairs of eigenvalues appear consecutively with the
*          eigenvalue having the positive imaginary part first.
*
*  VS      (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDVS,N)
*          If JOBVS = 'V', VS contains the orthogonal matrix Z of Schur
*          vectors.
*          If JOBVS = 'N', VS is not referenced.
*
*  LDVS    (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array VS.  LDVS >= 1, and if
*          JOBVS = 'V', LDVS >= N.
*
*  RCONDE  (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          If SENSE = 'E' or 'B', RCONDE contains the reciprocal
*          condition number for the average of the selected eigenvalues.
*          Not referenced if SENSE = 'N' or 'V'.
*
*  RCONDV  (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          If SENSE = 'V' or 'B', RCONDV contains the reciprocal
*          condition number for the selected right invariant subspace.
*          Not referenced if SENSE = 'N' or 'E'.
*
*  WORK    (workspace/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
*
*  LWORK   (input) INTEGER
*          The dimension of the array WORK.  LWORK >= max(1,3*N).
*          Also, if SENSE = 'E' or 'V' or 'B',
*          LWORK >= N+2*SDIM*(N-SDIM), where SDIM is the number of
*          selected eigenvalues computed by this routine.  Note that
*          N+2*SDIM*(N-SDIM) <= N+N*N/2. Note also that an error is only
*          returned if LWORK < max(1,3*N), but if SENSE = 'E' or 'V' or
*          'B' this may not be large enough.
*          For good performance, LWORK must generally be larger.
*
*          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
*          only calculates upper bounds on the optimal sizes of the
*          arrays WORK and IWORK, returns these values as the first
*          entries of the WORK and IWORK arrays, and no error messages
*          related to LWORK or LIWORK are issued by XERBLA.
*
*  IWORK   (workspace/output) INTEGER array, dimension (MAX(1,LIWORK))
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, IWORK(1) returns the optimal LIWORK.
*
*  LIWORK  (input) INTEGER
*          The dimension of the array IWORK.
*          LIWORK >= 1; if SENSE = 'V' or 'B', LIWORK >= SDIM*(N-SDIM).
*          Note that SDIM*(N-SDIM) <= N*N/4. Note also that an error is
*          only returned if LIWORK < 1, but if SENSE = 'V' or 'B' this
*          may not be large enough.
*
*          If LIWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the
*          routine only calculates upper bounds on the optimal sizes of
*          the arrays WORK and IWORK, returns these values as the first
*          entries of the WORK and IWORK arrays, and no error messages
*          related to LWORK or LIWORK are issued by XERBLA.
*
*  BWORK   (workspace) LOGICAL array, dimension (N)
*          Not referenced if SORT = 'N'.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0: successful exit
*          < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
*          > 0: if INFO = i, and i is
*             <= N: the QR algorithm failed to compute all the
*                   eigenvalues; elements 1:ILO-1 and i+1:N of WR and WI
*                   contain those eigenvalues which have converged; if
*                   JOBVS = 'V', VS contains the transformation which
*                   reduces A to its partially converged Schur form.
*             = N+1: the eigenvalues could not be reordered because some
*                   eigenvalues were too close to separate (the problem
*                   is very ill-conditioned);
*             = N+2: after reordering, roundoff changed values of some
*                   complex eigenvalues so that leading eigenvalues in
*                   the Schur form no longer satisfy SELECT=.TRUE.  This
*                   could also be caused by underflow due to scaling.

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE DGEBAL( JOB, N, A, LDA, ILO, IHI, SCALE, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DGEBAL balances a general real matrix A.  This involves, first,
*  permuting A by a similarity transformation to isolate eigenvalues
*  in the first 1 to ILO-1 and last IHI+1 to N elements on the
*  diagonal; and second, applying a diagonal similarity transformation
*  to rows and columns ILO to IHI to make the rows and columns as
*  close in norm as possible.  Both steps are optional.
*
*  Balancing may reduce the 1-norm of the matrix, and improve the
*  accuracy of the computed eigenvalues and/or eigenvectors.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  JOB     (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies the operations to be performed on A:
*          = 'N':  none:  simply set ILO = 1, IHI = N, SCALE(I) = 1.0
*                  for i = 1,...,N;
*          = 'P':  permute only;
*          = 'S':  scale only;
*          = 'B':  both permute and scale.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  A       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          On entry, the input matrix A.
*          On exit,  A is overwritten by the balanced matrix.
*          If JOB = 'N', A is not referenced.

*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
*
*  ILO     (output) INTEGER
*  IHI     (output) INTEGER
*          ILO and IHI are set to integers such that on exit
*          A(i,j) = 0 if i > j and j = 1,...,ILO-1 or I = IHI+1,...,N.
*          If JOB = 'N' or 'S', ILO = 1 and IHI = N.
*
*  SCALE   (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          Details of the permutations and scaling factors applied to
*          A.  If P(j) is the index of the row and column interchanged
*          with row and column j and D(j) is the scaling factor
*          applied to row and column j, then
*          SCALE(j) = P(j)    for j = 1,...,ILO-1
*                   = D(j)    for j = ILO,...,IHI
*                   = P(j)    for j = IHI+1,...,N.
*          The order in which the interchanges are made is N to IHI+1,
*          then 1 to ILO-1.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit.
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
*

*  Further Details
*  ===============
*
*  The permutations consist of row and column interchanges which put
*  the matrix in the form
*
*             ( T1   X   Y  )
*     P A P = (  0   B   Z  )
*             (  0   0   T2 )
*
*  where T1 and T2 are upper triangular matrices whose eigenvalues lie
*  along the diagonal.  The column indices ILO and IHI mark the starting
*  and ending columns of the submatrix B. Balancing consists of applying
*  a diagonal similarity transformation inv(D) * B * D to make the
*  1-norms of each row of B and its corresponding column nearly equal.
*  The output matrix is
*
*     ( T1     X*D          Y    )
*     (  0  inv(D)*B*D  inv(D)*Z ).
*     (  0      0           T2   )
*
*  Information about the permutations P and the diagonal matrix D is
*  returned in the vector SCALE.
*
*  This subroutine is based on the EISPACK routine BALANC.

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE DGESDD( JOBZ, M, N, A, LDA, S, U, LDU, VT, LDVT, WORK, LWORK, IWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DGESDD computes the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a real
*  M-by-N matrix A, optionally computing the left and right singular
*  vectors.  If singular vectors are desired, it uses a
*  divide-and-conquer algorithm.
*
*  The SVD is written
*
*       A = U * SIGMA * transpose(V)
*
*  where SIGMA is an M-by-N matrix which is zero except for its
*  min(m,n) diagonal elements, U is an M-by-M orthogonal matrix, and
*  V is an N-by-N orthogonal matrix.  The diagonal elements of SIGMA
*  are the singular values of A; they are real and non-negative, and
*  are returned in descending order.  The first min(m,n) columns of
*  U and V are the left and right singular vectors of A.
*
*  Note that the routine returns VT = V**T, not V.
*
*  The divide and conquer algorithm makes very mild assumptions about
*  floating point arithmetic. It will work on machines with a guard
*  digit in add/subtract, or on those binary machines without guard
*  digits which subtract like the Cray X-MP, Cray Y-MP, Cray C-90, or
*  Cray-2. It could conceivably fail on hexadecimal or decimal machines
*  without guard digits, but we know of none.

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DGEEVX computes for an N-by-N real nonsymmetric matrix A, the
*  eigenvalues and, optionally, the left and/or right eigenvectors.
*
*  Optionally also, it computes a balancing transformation to improve
*  the conditioning of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors (ILO, IHI,
*  SCALE, and ABNRM), reciprocal condition numbers for the eigenvalues
*  (RCONDE), and reciprocal condition numbers for the right

*
*  The right eigenvector v(j) of A satisfies
*                   A * v(j) = lambda(j) * v(j)

*  The left eigenvector u(j) of A satisfies
*                u(j)**H * A = lambda(j) * u(j)**H
*  where u(j)**H denotes the conjugate transpose of u(j).
*
*  The computed eigenvectors are normalized to have Euclidean norm
*  equal to 1 and largest component real.
*
*  Balancing a matrix means permuting the rows and columns to make it
*  more nearly upper triangular, and applying a diagonal similarity
*  transformation D * A * D**(-1), where D is a diagonal matrix, to
*  make its rows and columns closer in norm and the condition numbers
*  of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors smaller.  The computed
*  reciprocal condition numbers correspond to the balanced matrix.
*  Permuting rows and columns will not change the condition numbers
*  (in exact arithmetic) but diagonal scaling will.  For further
*  explanation of balancing, see section 4.10.2 of the LAPACK

*                 D*A*D**(-1), where D is a diagonal matrix chosen
*                 to make the rows and columns of A more equal in
*                 norm. Do not permute;
*          = 'B': Both diagonally scale and permute A.
*
*          Computed reciprocal condition numbers will be for the matrix
*          after balancing and/or permuting. Permuting does not change

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DGEES computes for an N-by-N real nonsymmetric matrix A, the
*  eigenvalues, the real Schur form T, and, optionally, the matrix of
*  Schur vectors Z.  This gives the Schur factorization A = Z*T*(Z**T).
*
*  Optionally, it also orders the eigenvalues on the diagonal of the
*  real Schur form so that selected eigenvalues are at the top left.
*  The leading columns of Z then form an orthonormal basis for the
*  invariant subspace corresponding to the selected eigenvalues.
*
*  A matrix is in real Schur form if it is upper quasi-triangular with
*  1-by-1 and 2-by-2 blocks. 2-by-2 blocks will be standardized in the
*  form
*          [  a  b  ]
*          [  c  a  ]
*
*  where b*c < 0. The eigenvalues of such a block are a +- sqrt(bc).
*

*  Arguments

*
*  SELECT  (external procedure) LOGICAL FUNCTION of two DOUBLE PRECISION arguments

*          conjugate pair of eigenvalues is selected, then both complex
*          eigenvalues are selected.

*
*  SDIM    (output) INTEGER
*          If SORT = 'N', SDIM = 0.
*          If SORT = 'S', SDIM = number of eigenvalues (after sorting)
*                         for which SELECT is true. (Complex conjugate

*
*  WR      (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*  WI      (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          WR and WI contain the real and imaginary parts,

*  Purpose
*  =======

*
*  A       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA, N)

*          On exit, the factors L and U from the factorization
*          A = P*L*U*Q; the unit diagonal elements of L are not stored.
*          If U(k, k) appears to be less than SMIN, U(k, k) is given the

*
*  IPIV    (output) INTEGER array, dimension(N).

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  This routine is deprecated and has been replaced by routine DGELSY.
*
*  DGELSX computes the minimum-norm solution to a real linear least
*  squares problem:
*      minimize || A * X - B ||
*  using a complete orthogonal factorization of A.  A is an M-by-N
*  matrix which may be rank-deficient.
*
*  Several right hand side vectors b and solution vectors x can be
*  handled in a single call; they are stored as the columns of the
*  M-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B and the N-by-NRHS solution
*  matrix X.
*
*  The routine first computes a QR factorization with column pivoting:
*      A * P = Q * [ R11 R12 ]
*                  [  0  R22 ]
*  with R11 defined as the largest leading submatrix whose estimated
*  condition number is less than 1/RCOND.  The order of R11, RANK,
*  is the effective rank of A.
*
*  Then, R22 is considered to be negligible, and R12 is annihilated
*  by orthogonal transformations from the right, arriving at the
*  complete orthogonal factorization:
*     A * P = Q * [ T11 0 ] * Z
*                 [  0  0 ]
*  The minimum-norm solution is then

*          free columns are moved as a result of column pivoting
*          during the factorization.
*          On exit, if JPVT(i) = k, then the i-th column of A*P
*          was the k-th column of A.
*
*  RCOND   (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          RCOND is used to determine the effective rank of A, which

*  and the columns of Z are the right Schur vectors.
*
*  If only the eigenvalues of (A,B) are needed, the driver routine

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE DGESVX( FACT, TRANS, N, NRHS, A, LDA, AF, LDAF, IPIV, EQUED, R, C, B, LDB, X, LDX, RCOND, FERR, BERR, WORK, IWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DGESVX uses the LU factorization to compute the solution to a real
*  system of linear equations
*     A * X = B,
*  where A is an N-by-N matrix and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.
*
*  Error bounds on the solution and a condition estimate are also
*  provided.
*
*  Description
*  ===========
*
*  The following steps are performed:
*
*  1. If FACT = 'E', real scaling factors are computed to equilibrate
*     the system:
*        TRANS = 'N':  diag(R)*A*diag(C)     *inv(diag(C))*X = diag(R)*B
*        TRANS = 'T': (diag(R)*A*diag(C))**T *inv(diag(R))*X = diag(C)*B
*        TRANS = 'C': (diag(R)*A*diag(C))**H *inv(diag(R))*X = diag(C)*B
*     Whether or not the system will be equilibrated depends on the
*     scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, A is
*     overwritten by diag(R)*A*diag(C) and B by diag(R)*B (if TRANS='N')
*     or diag(C)*B (if TRANS = 'T' or 'C').
*
*  2. If FACT = 'N' or 'E', the LU decomposition is used to factor the
*     matrix A (after equilibration if FACT = 'E') as
*        A = P * L * U,
*     where P is a permutation matrix, L is a unit lower triangular
*     matrix, and U is upper triangular.
*
*  3. If some U(i,i)=0, so that U is exactly singular, then the routine
*     returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored form of A is used
*     to estimate the condition number of the matrix A.  If the
*     reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine precision,
*     INFO = N+1 is returned as a warning, but the routine still goes on
*     to solve for X and compute error bounds as described below.
*
*  4. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
*     of A.
*
*  5. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution
*     matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates
*     for it.
*
*  6. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by
*     diag(C) (if TRANS = 'N') or diag(R) (if TRANS = 'T' or 'C') so
*     that it solves the original system before equilibration.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  FACT    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies whether or not the factored form of the matrix A is
*          supplied on entry, and if not, whether the matrix A should be

*
*          On exit, if EQUED .ne. 'N', A is scaled as follows:
*          EQUED = 'R':  A := diag(R) * A
*          EQUED = 'C':  A := A * diag(C)
*          EQUED = 'B':  A := diag(R) * A * diag(C).

*
*          If FACT = 'E', then AF is an output argument and on exit
*          returns the factors L and U from the factorization A = P*L*U
*          of the equilibrated matrix A (see the description of A for
*          the form of the equilibrated matrix).
*
*  LDAF    (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array AF.  LDAF >= max(1,N).

*          as computed by DGETRF; row i of the matrix was interchanged
*          with row IPIV(i).
*
*          If FACT = 'N', then IPIV is an output argument and on exit
*          contains the pivot indices from the factorization A = P*L*U

*          contains the pivot indices from the factorization A = P*L*U
*          of the equilibrated matrix A.
*
*  EQUED   (input or output) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies the form of equilibration that was done.
*          = 'N':  No equilibration (always true if FACT = 'N').
*          = 'R':  Row equilibration, i.e., A has been premultiplied by
*                  diag(R).
*          = 'C':  Column equilibration, i.e., A has been postmultiplied
*                  by diag(C).
*          = 'B':  Both row and column equilibration, i.e., A has been
*                  replaced by diag(R) * A * diag(C).
*          EQUED is an input argument if FACT = 'F'; otherwise, it is an
*          output argument.
*
*  R       (input or output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          The row scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'R' or 'B', A is
*          multiplied on the left by diag(R); if EQUED = 'N' or 'C', R
*          is not accessed.  R is an input argument if FACT = 'F';
*          otherwise, R is an output argument.  If FACT = 'F' and
*          EQUED = 'R' or 'B', each element of R must be positive.
*
*  C       (input or output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          The column scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'C' or 'B', A is
*          multiplied on the right by diag(C); if EQUED = 'N' or 'R', C
*          is not accessed.  C is an input argument if FACT = 'F';
*          otherwise, C is an output argument.  If FACT = 'F' and
*          EQUED = 'C' or 'B', each element of C must be positive.
*
*  B       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
*          On entry, the N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.
*          On exit,
*          if EQUED = 'N', B is not modified;
*          if TRANS = 'N' and EQUED = 'R' or 'B', B is overwritten by
*          diag(R)*B;
*          if TRANS = 'T' or 'C' and EQUED = 'C' or 'B', B is

*

*          If INFO = 0 or INFO = N+1, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X
*          to the original system of equations.  Note that A and B are
*          modified on exit if EQUED .ne. 'N', and the solution to the
*          equilibrated system is inv(diag(C))*X if TRANS = 'N' and
*          EQUED = 'C' or 'B', or inv(diag(R))*X if TRANS = 'T' or 'C'
*          and EQUED = 'R' or 'B'.
*
*  LDX     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
*
*  RCOND   (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The estimate of the reciprocal condition number of the matrix
*          A after equilibration (if done).  If RCOND is less than the
*          machine precision (in particular, if RCOND = 0), the matrix
*          is singular to working precision.  This condition is
*          indicated by a return code of INFO > 0.
*
*  FERR    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
*          The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
*          X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
*          If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
*          is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
*          element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
*          largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
*          the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight
*          overestimate of the true error.
*
*  BERR    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
*          The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
*          vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
*          any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).
*
*  WORK    (workspace/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (4*N)
*          On exit, WORK(1) contains the reciprocal pivot growth
*          factor norm(A)/norm(U). The "max absolute element" norm is
*          used. If WORK(1) is much less than 1, then the stability
*          of the LU factorization of the (equilibrated) matrix A
*          could be poor. This also means that the solution X, condition
*          estimator RCOND, and forward error bound FERR could be
*          unreliable. If factorization fails with 0<INFO<=N, then
*          WORK(1) contains the reciprocal pivot growth factor for the
*          leading INFO columns of A.
*
*  IWORK   (workspace) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0:  if INFO = i, and i is
*                <= N:  U(i,i) is exactly zero.  The factorization has
*                       been completed, but the factor U is exactly
*                       singular, so the solution and error bounds
*                       could not be computed. RCOND = 0 is returned.
*                = N+1: U is nonsingular, but RCOND is less than machine
*                       precision, meaning that the matrix is singular
*                       to working precision.  Nevertheless, the
*                       solution and error bounds are computed because
*                       there are a number of situations where the
*                       computed solution can be more accurate than the
*                       value of RCOND would suggest.

      SUBROUTINE DGETRF( M, N, A, LDA, IPIV, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DGETRF computes an LU factorization of a general M-by-N matrix A
*  using partial pivoting with row interchanges.
*
*  The factorization has the form
*     A = P * L * U
*  where P is a permutation matrix, L is lower triangular with unit
*  diagonal elements (lower trapezoidal if m > n), and U is upper
*  triangular (upper trapezoidal if m < n).
*
*  This is the right-looking Level 3 BLAS version of the algorithm.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  M       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of rows of the matrix A.  M >= 0.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of columns of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  A       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          On entry, the M-by-N matrix to be factored.
*          On exit, the factors L and U from the factorization
*          A = P*L*U; the unit diagonal elements of L are not stored.
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,M).
*
*  IPIV    (output) INTEGER array, dimension (min(M,N))
*          The pivot indices; for 1 <= i <= min(M,N), row i of the
*          matrix was interchanged with row IPIV(i).
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0:  if INFO = i, U(i,i) is exactly zero. The factorization
*                has been completed, but the factor U is exactly
*                singular, and division by zero will occur if it is used
*                to solve a system of equations.

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE DGELSS( M, N, NRHS, A, LDA, B, LDB, S, RCOND, RANK, WORK, LWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DGELSS computes the minimum norm solution to a real linear least
*  squares problem:
*
*  Minimize 2-norm(| b - A*x |).
*
*  using the singular value decomposition (SVD) of A. A is an M-by-N
*  matrix which may be rank-deficient.
*
*  Several right hand side vectors b and solution vectors x can be
*  handled in a single call; they are stored as the columns of the
*  M-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B and the N-by-NRHS solution matrix
*  X.
*
*  The effective rank of A is determined by treating as zero those
*  singular values which are less than RCOND times the largest singular
*  value.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  M       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of rows of the matrix A. M >= 0.
*

*
*  A       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          On entry, the M-by-N matrix A.
*          On exit, the first min(m,n) rows of A are overwritten with

*          matrix X.  If m >= n and RANK = n, the residual
*          sum-of-squares for the solution in the i-th column is given
*          by the sum of squares of elements n+1:m in that column.

*
*  RCOND   (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          RCOND is used to determine the effective rank of A.

*          If RCOND < 0, machine precision is used instead.
*
*  RANK    (output) INTEGER
*          The effective rank of A, i.e., the number of singular values
*          which are greater than RCOND*S(1).
*
*  WORK    (workspace/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
*
*  LWORK   (input) INTEGER
*          The dimension of the array WORK. LWORK >= 1, and also:
*          LWORK >= 3*min(M,N) + max( 2*min(M,N), max(M,N), NRHS )
*          For good performance, LWORK should generally be larger.
*
*          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
*          only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
*          this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
*          message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE DGELSD( M, N, NRHS, A, LDA, B, LDB, S, RCOND, RANK, WORK, LWORK, IWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DGELSD computes the minimum-norm solution to a real linear least
*  squares problem:
*      minimize 2-norm(| b - A*x |)
*  using the singular value decomposition (SVD) of A. A is an M-by-N
*  matrix which may be rank-deficient.
*
*  Several right hand side vectors b and solution vectors x can be
*  handled in a single call; they are stored as the columns of the
*  M-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B and the N-by-NRHS solution
*  matrix X.
*
*  The problem is solved in three steps:
*  (1) Reduce the coefficient matrix A to bidiagonal form with
*      Householder transformations, reducing the original problem
*      into a "bidiagonal least squares problem" (BLS)
*  (2) Solve the BLS using a divide and conquer approach.
*  (3) Apply back all the Householder tranformations to solve
*      the original least squares problem.
*
*  The effective rank of A is determined by treating as zero those
*  singular values which are less than RCOND times the largest singular
*  value.
*
*  The divide and conquer algorithm makes very mild assumptions about
*  floating point arithmetic. It will work on machines with a guard
*  digit in add/subtract, or on those binary machines without guard
*  digits which subtract like the Cray X-MP, Cray Y-MP, Cray C-90, or
*  Cray-2. It could conceivably fail on hexadecimal or decimal machines
*  without guard digits, but we know of none.

*          The singular values of A in decreasing order.

*
*  RCOND   (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          RCOND is used to determine the effective rank of A.

*

*          The effective rank of A, i.e., the number of singular values

*
*  LWORK   (input) INTEGER
*          The dimension of the array WORK. LWORK must be at least 1.
*          The exact minimum amount of workspace needed depends on M,

*              12*N + 2*N*SMLSIZ + 8*N*NLVL + N*NRHS + (SMLSIZ+1)**2,
*          if M is greater than or equal to N or

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE DGEGV( JOBVL, JOBVR, N, A, LDA, B, LDB, ALPHAR, ALPHAI, BETA, VL, LDVL, VR, LDVR, WORK, LWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  This routine is deprecated and has been replaced by routine DGGEV.
*
*  DGEGV computes the eigenvalues and, optionally, the left and/or right
*  eigenvectors of a real matrix pair (A,B).
*  Given two square matrices A and B,
*  the generalized nonsymmetric eigenvalue problem (GNEP) is to find the
*  eigenvalues lambda and corresponding (non-zero) eigenvectors x such
*  that
*
*     A*x = lambda*B*x.
*
*  An alternate form is to find the eigenvalues mu and corresponding
*  eigenvectors y such that
*
*     mu*A*y = B*y.
*
*  These two forms are equivalent with mu = 1/lambda and x = y if
*  neither lambda nor mu is zero.  In order to deal with the case that
*  lambda or mu is zero or small, two values alpha and beta are returned
*  for each eigenvalue, such that lambda = alpha/beta and
*  mu = beta/alpha.
*
*  The vectors x and y in the above equations are right eigenvectors of
*  the matrix pair (A,B).  Vectors u and v satisfying
*
*     u**H*A = lambda*u**H*B  or  mu*v**H*A = v**H*B
*
*  are left eigenvectors of (A,B).
*
*  Note: this routine performs "full balancing" on A and B -- see
*  "Further Details", below.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  JOBVL   (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'N':  do not compute the left generalized eigenvectors;
*          = 'V':  compute the left generalized eigenvectors (returned
*                  in VL).
*
*  JOBVR   (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'N':  do not compute the right generalized eigenvectors;
*          = 'V':  compute the right generalized eigenvectors (returned
*                  in VR).
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrices A, B, VL, and VR.  N >= 0.
*
*  A       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA, N)
*          On entry, the matrix A.
*          If JOBVL = 'V' or JOBVR = 'V', then on exit A
*          contains the real Schur form of A from the generalized Schur
*          factorization of the pair (A,B) after balancing.
*          If no eigenvectors were computed, then only the diagonal
*          blocks from the Schur form will be correct.  See DGGHRD and
*          DHGEQZ for details.
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER

*          On entry, the matrix B.
*          If JOBVL = 'V' or JOBVR = 'V', then on exit B contains the
*          upper triangular matrix obtained from B in the generalized
*          Schur factorization of the pair (A,B) after balancing.
*          If no eigenvectors were computed, then only those elements of
*          B corresponding to the diagonal blocks from the Schur form of
*          A will be correct.  See DGGHRD and DHGEQZ for details.
*
*  LDB     (input) INTEGER

*
*  ALPHAR  (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          The real parts of each scalar alpha defining an eigenvalue of
*          GNEP.
*
*  ALPHAI  (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          The imaginary parts of each scalar alpha defining an
*          eigenvalue of GNEP.  If ALPHAI(j) is zero, then the j-th
*          eigenvalue is real; if positive, then the j-th and

*          beta = BETA(j) represent the j-th eigenvalue of the matrix
*          pair (A,B), in one of the forms lambda = alpha/beta or
*          mu = beta/alpha.  Since either lambda or mu may overflow,
*          they should not, in general, be computed.
*
*  VL      (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDVL,N)
*          If JOBVL = 'V', the left eigenvectors u(j) are stored
*          in the columns of VL, in the same order as their eigenvalues.
*          If the j-th eigenvalue is real, then u(j) = VL(:,j).
*          If the j-th and (j+1)-st eigenvalues form a complex conjugate
*          pair, then

*          The dimension of the array WORK.  LWORK >= max(1,8*N).

*  Balancing
*  ---------
*
*  This driver calls DGGBAL to both permute and scale rows and columns
*  of A and B.  The permutations PL and PR are chosen so that PL*A*PR
*  and PL*B*R will be upper triangular except for the diagonal blocks
*  A(i:j,i:j) and B(i:j,i:j), with i and j as close together as
*  possible.  The diagonal scaling matrices DL and DR are chosen so
*  that the pair  DL*PL*A*PR*DR, DL*PL*B*PR*DR have elements close to
*  one (except for the elements that start out zero.)
*
*  After the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the balanced matrices
*  have been computed, DGGBAK transforms the eigenvectors back to what
*  they would have been (in perfect arithmetic) if they had not been
*  balanced.
*
*  Contents of A and B on Exit
*  -------- -- - --- - -- ----
*
*  If any eigenvectors are computed (either JOBVL='V' or JOBVR='V' or
*  both), then on exit the arrays A and B will contain the real Schur
*  form[*] of the "balanced" versions of A and B.  If no eigenvectors
*  are computed, then only the diagonal blocks will be correct.

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE DGELSY( M, N, NRHS, A, LDA, B, LDB, JPVT, RCOND, RANK, WORK, LWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DGELSY computes the minimum-norm solution to a real linear least
*  squares problem:
*      minimize || A * X - B ||
*  using a complete orthogonal factorization of A.  A is an M-by-N
*  matrix which may be rank-deficient.
*
*  Several right hand side vectors b and solution vectors x can be
*  handled in a single call; they are stored as the columns of the
*  M-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B and the N-by-NRHS solution
*  matrix X.
*
*  The routine first computes a QR factorization with column pivoting:
*      A * P = Q * [ R11 R12 ]
*                  [  0  R22 ]
*  with R11 defined as the largest leading submatrix whose estimated
*  condition number is less than 1/RCOND.  The order of R11, RANK,
*  is the effective rank of A.
*
*  Then, R22 is considered to be negligible, and R12 is annihilated
*  by orthogonal transformations from the right, arriving at the
*  complete orthogonal factorization:
*     A * P = Q * [ T11 0 ] * Z
*                 [  0  0 ]
*  The minimum-norm solution is then
*     X = P * Z' [ inv(T11)*Q1'*B ]
*                [        0       ]
*  where Q1 consists of the first RANK columns of Q.
*
*  This routine is basically identical to the original xGELSX except
*  three differences:
*    o The call to the subroutine xGEQPF has been substituted by the
*      the call to the subroutine xGEQP3. This subroutine is a Blas-3
*      version of the QR factorization with column pivoting.
*    o Matrix B (the right hand side) is updated with Blas-3.
*    o The permutation of matrix B (the right hand side) is faster and
*      more simple.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*

*          The number of rows of the matrix A.  M >= 0.

*
*  A       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)

*
*  JPVT    (input/output) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*          On entry, if JPVT(i) .ne. 0, the i-th column of A is permuted
*          to the front of AP, otherwise column i is a free column.
*          On exit, if JPVT(i) = k, then the i-th column of AP
*          was the k-th column of A.
*
*  RCOND   (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          RCOND is used to determine the effective rank of A, which
*          is defined as the order of the largest leading triangular

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE DGETF2( M, N, A, LDA, IPIV, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DGETF2 computes an LU factorization of a general m-by-n matrix A
*  using partial pivoting with row interchanges.
*
*  The factorization has the form
*     A = P * L * U
*  where P is a permutation matrix, L is lower triangular with unit
*  diagonal elements (lower trapezoidal if m > n), and U is upper
*  triangular (upper trapezoidal if m < n).
*
*  This is the right-looking Level 2 BLAS version of the algorithm.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  M       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of rows of the matrix A.  M >= 0.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of columns of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  A       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          On entry, the m by n matrix to be factored.
*          On exit, the factors L and U from the factorization
*          A = P*L*U; the unit diagonal elements of L are not stored.
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,M).
*
*  IPIV    (output) INTEGER array, dimension (min(M,N))
*          The pivot indices; for 1 <= i <= min(M,N), row i of the
*          matrix was interchanged with row IPIV(i).
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0: successful exit
*          < 0: if INFO = -k, the k-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0: if INFO = k, U(k,k) is exactly zero. The factorization
*               has been completed, but the factor U is exactly
*               singular, and division by zero will occur if it is used
*               to solve a system of equations.

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE DGEEQU( M, N, A, LDA, R, C, ROWCND, COLCND, AMAX, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DGEEQU computes row and column scalings intended to equilibrate an
*  M-by-N matrix A and reduce its condition number.  R returns the row
*  scale factors and C the column scale factors, chosen to try to make
*  the largest element in each row and column of the matrix B with
*  elements B(i,j)=R(i)*A(i,j)*C(j) have absolute value 1.
*
*  R(i) and C(j) are restricted to be between SMLNUM = smallest safe
*  number and BIGNUM = largest safe number.  Use of these scaling
*  factors is not guaranteed to reduce the condition number of A but
*  works well in practice.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  M       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of rows of the matrix A.  M >= 0.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER

*
*  A       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          The M-by-N matrix whose equilibration factors are
*          to be computed.
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,M).
*
*  R       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (M)
*          If INFO = 0 or INFO > M, R contains the row scale factors
*          for A.
*
*  C       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          If INFO = 0,  C contains the column scale factors for A.
*
*  ROWCND  (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          If INFO = 0 or INFO > M, ROWCND contains the ratio of the
*          smallest R(i) to the largest R(i).  If ROWCND >= 0.1 and
*          AMAX is neither too large nor too small, it is not worth
*          scaling by R.
*
*  COLCND  (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          If INFO = 0, COLCND contains the ratio of the smallest
*          C(i) to the largest C(i).  If COLCND >= 0.1, it is not
*          worth scaling by C.
*
*  AMAX    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          Absolute value of largest matrix element.  If AMAX is very
*          close to overflow or very close to underflow, the matrix
*          should be scaled.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0:  if INFO = i,  and i is
*                <= M:  the i-th row of A is exactly zero
*                >  M:  the (i-M)-th column of A is exactly zero
