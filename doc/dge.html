FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE DGEBAL( JOB, N, A, LDA, ILO, IHI, SCALE, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DGEBAL balances a general real matrix A.  This involves, first,
*  permuting A by a similarity transformation to isolate eigenvalues
*  in the first 1 to ILO-1 and last IHI+1 to N elements on the
*  diagonal; and second, applying a diagonal similarity transformation
*  to rows and columns ILO to IHI to make the rows and columns as
*  close in norm as possible.  Both steps are optional.
*
*  Balancing may reduce the 1-norm of the matrix, and improve the
*  accuracy of the computed eigenvalues and/or eigenvectors.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  JOB     (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies the operations to be performed on A:
*          = 'N':  none:  simply set ILO = 1, IHI = N, SCALE(I) = 1.0
*                  for i = 1,...,N;
*          = 'P':  permute only;
*          = 'S':  scale only;
*          = 'B':  both permute and scale.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  A       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          On entry, the input matrix A.
*          On exit,  A is overwritten by the balanced matrix.
*          If JOB = 'N', A is not referenced.
*          See Further Details.
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
*
*  ILO     (output) INTEGER
*  IHI     (output) INTEGER
*          ILO and IHI are set to integers such that on exit
*          A(i,j) = 0 if i > j and j = 1,...,ILO-1 or I = IHI+1,...,N.
*          If JOB = 'N' or 'S', ILO = 1 and IHI = N.
*
*  SCALE   (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          Details of the permutations and scaling factors applied to
*          A.  If P(j) is the index of the row and column interchanged
*          with row and column j and D(j) is the scaling factor
*          applied to row and column j, then
*          SCALE(j) = P(j)    for j = 1,...,ILO-1
*                   = D(j)    for j = ILO,...,IHI
*                   = P(j)    for j = IHI+1,...,N.
*          The order in which the interchanges are made is N to IHI+1,
*          then 1 to ILO-1.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit.
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
*

*  Further Details
*  ===============
*
*  The permutations consist of row and column interchanges which put
*  the matrix in the form
*
*             ( T1   X   Y  )
*     P A P = (  0   B   Z  )
*             (  0   0   T2 )
*
*  where T1 and T2 are upper triangular matrices whose eigenvalues lie
*  along the diagonal.  The column indices ILO and IHI mark the starting
*  and ending columns of the submatrix B. Balancing consists of applying
*  a diagonal similarity transformation inv(D) * B * D to make the
*  1-norms of each row of B and its corresponding column nearly equal.
*  The output matrix is
*
*     ( T1     X*D          Y    )
*     (  0  inv(D)*B*D  inv(D)*Z ).
*     (  0      0           T2   )
*
*  Information about the permutations P and the diagonal matrix D is
*  returned in the vector SCALE.
*
*  This subroutine is based on the EISPACK routine BALANC.

      SUBROUTINE DGEBRD( M, N, A, LDA, D, E, TAUQ, TAUP, WORK, LWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DGEBRD reduces a general real M-by-N matrix A to upper or lower
*  bidiagonal form B by an orthogonal transformation: Q**T * A * P = B.
*
*  If m >= n, B is upper bidiagonal; if m < n, B is lower bidiagonal.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  M       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of rows in the matrix A.  M >= 0.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of columns in the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  A       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          On entry, the M-by-N general matrix to be reduced.
*          On exit,
*          if m >= n, the diagonal and the first superdiagonal are
*            overwritten with the upper bidiagonal matrix B; the
*            elements below the diagonal, with the array TAUQ, represent
*            the orthogonal matrix Q as a product of elementary
*            reflectors, and the elements above the first superdiagonal,
*            with the array TAUP, represent the orthogonal matrix P as
*            a product of elementary reflectors;
*          if m < n, the diagonal and the first subdiagonal are
*            overwritten with the lower bidiagonal matrix B; the
*            elements below the first subdiagonal, with the array TAUQ,
*            represent the orthogonal matrix Q as a product of
*            elementary reflectors, and the elements above the diagonal,
*            with the array TAUP, represent the orthogonal matrix P as
*            a product of elementary reflectors.
*          See Further Details.
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,M).
*
*  D       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (min(M,N))

*          The off-diagonal elements of the bidiagonal matrix B:
*          if m >= n, E(i) = A(i,i+1) for i = 1,2,...,n-1;
*          if m < n, E(i) = A(i+1,i) for i = 1,2,...,m-1.
*
*  TAUQ    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array dimension (min(M,N))
*          The scalar factors of the elementary reflectors which
*          represent the orthogonal matrix Q. See Further Details.
*
*  TAUP    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (min(M,N))
*          The scalar factors of the elementary reflectors which
*          represent the orthogonal matrix P. See Further Details.
*
*  WORK    (workspace/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
*
*  LWORK   (input) INTEGER
*          The length of the array WORK.  LWORK >= max(1,M,N).
*          For optimum performance LWORK >= (M+N)*NB, where NB
*          is the optimal blocksize.
*
*          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
*          only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
*          this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
*          message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE DGEEQUB( M, N, A, LDA, R, C, ROWCND, COLCND, AMAX, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DGEEQUB computes row and column scalings intended to equilibrate an
*  M-by-N matrix A and reduce its condition number.  R returns the row
*  scale factors and C the column scale factors, chosen to try to make
*  the largest element in each row and column of the matrix B with
*  elements B(i,j)=R(i)*A(i,j)*C(j) have an absolute value of at most
*  the radix.
*
*  R(i) and C(j) are restricted to be a power of the radix between
*  SMLNUM = smallest safe number and BIGNUM = largest safe number.  Use
*  of these scaling factors is not guaranteed to reduce the condition
*  number of A but works well in practice.
*
*  This routine differs from DGEEQU by restricting the scaling factors
*  to a power of the radix.  Baring over- and underflow, scaling by
*  these factors introduces no additional rounding errors.  However, the
*  scaled entries' magnitured are no longer approximately 1 but lie
*  between sqrt(radix) and 1/sqrt(radix).
*

*  Arguments

*  A matrix is in real Schur form if it is upper quasi-triangular with

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE DGEEVX( BALANC, JOBVL, JOBVR, SENSE, N, A, LDA, WR, WI, VL, LDVL, VR, LDVR, ILO, IHI, SCALE, ABNRM, RCONDE, RCONDV, WORK, LWORK, IWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DGEEVX computes for an N-by-N real nonsymmetric matrix A, the
*  eigenvalues and, optionally, the left and/or right eigenvectors.
*
*  Optionally also, it computes a balancing transformation to improve
*  the conditioning of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors (ILO, IHI,
*  SCALE, and ABNRM), reciprocal condition numbers for the eigenvalues
*  (RCONDE), and reciprocal condition numbers for the right
*  eigenvectors (RCONDV).
*
*  The right eigenvector v(j) of A satisfies
*                   A * v(j) = lambda(j) * v(j)
*  where lambda(j) is its eigenvalue.
*  The left eigenvector u(j) of A satisfies
*                u(j)**H * A = lambda(j) * u(j)**H
*  where u(j)**H denotes the conjugate transpose of u(j).
*
*  The computed eigenvectors are normalized to have Euclidean norm
*  equal to 1 and largest component real.
*
*  Balancing a matrix means permuting the rows and columns to make it
*  more nearly upper triangular, and applying a diagonal similarity
*  transformation D * A * D**(-1), where D is a diagonal matrix, to
*  make its rows and columns closer in norm and the condition numbers
*  of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors smaller.  The computed
*  reciprocal condition numbers correspond to the balanced matrix.
*  Permuting rows and columns will not change the condition numbers
*  (in exact arithmetic) but diagonal scaling will.  For further
*  explanation of balancing, see section 4.10.2 of the LAPACK
*  Users' Guide.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  BALANC  (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Indicates how the input matrix should be diagonally scaled
*          and/or permuted to improve the conditioning of its
*          eigenvalues.
*          = 'N': Do not diagonally scale or permute;
*          = 'P': Perform permutations to make the matrix more nearly
*                 upper triangular. Do not diagonally scale;
*          = 'S': Diagonally scale the matrix, i.e. replace A by
*                 D*A*D**(-1), where D is a diagonal matrix chosen
*                 to make the rows and columns of A more equal in
*                 norm. Do not permute;
*          = 'B': Both diagonally scale and permute A.
*
*          Computed reciprocal condition numbers will be for the matrix
*          after balancing and/or permuting. Permuting does not change
*          condition numbers (in exact arithmetic), but balancing does.

*          Determines which reciprocal condition numbers are computed.
*          = 'N': None are computed;

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE DGEGS( JOBVSL, JOBVSR, N, A, LDA, B, LDB, ALPHAR, ALPHAI, BETA, VSL, LDVSL, VSR, LDVSR, WORK, LWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  This routine is deprecated and has been replaced by routine DGGES.
*
*  DGEGS computes the eigenvalues, real Schur form, and, optionally,
*  left and or/right Schur vectors of a real matrix pair (A,B).
*  Given two square matrices A and B, the generalized real Schur
*  factorization has the form
*
*    A = Q*S*Z**T,  B = Q*T*Z**T
*
*  where Q and Z are orthogonal matrices, T is upper triangular, and S
*  is an upper quasi-triangular matrix with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal
*  blocks, the 2-by-2 blocks corresponding to complex conjugate pairs
*  of eigenvalues of (A,B).  The columns of Q are the left Schur vectors
*  and the columns of Z are the right Schur vectors.
*
*  If only the eigenvalues of (A,B) are needed, the driver routine
*  DGEGV should be used instead.  See DGEGV for a description of the
*  eigenvalues of the generalized nonsymmetric eigenvalue problem
*  (GNEP).
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  JOBVSL  (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'N':  do not compute the left Schur vectors;
*          = 'V':  compute the left Schur vectors (returned in VSL).
*
*  JOBVSR  (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'N':  do not compute the right Schur vectors;
*          = 'V':  compute the right Schur vectors (returned in VSR).
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER

*
*  A       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA, N)
*          On entry, the matrix A.

*
*  ALPHAR  (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          The real parts of each scalar alpha defining an eigenvalue
*          of GNEP.
*
*  ALPHAI  (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          The imaginary parts of each scalar alpha defining an
*          eigenvalue of GNEP.  If ALPHAI(j) is zero, then the j-th
*          eigenvalue is real; if positive, then the j-th and (j+1)-st
*          eigenvalues are a complex conjugate pair, with
*          ALPHAI(j+1) = -ALPHAI(j).
*
*  BETA    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          The scalars beta that define the eigenvalues of GNEP.
*          Together, the quantities alpha = (ALPHAR(j),ALPHAI(j)) and
*          beta = BETA(j) represent the j-th eigenvalue of the matrix
*          pair (A,B), in one of the forms lambda = alpha/beta or
*          mu = beta/alpha.  Since either lambda or mu may overflow,
*          they should not, in general, be computed.
*
*  VSL     (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDVSL,N)
*          If JOBVSL = 'V', the matrix of left Schur vectors Q.

*          On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
*
*  LWORK   (input) INTEGER
*          The dimension of the array WORK.  LWORK >= max(1,4*N).
*          For good performance, LWORK must generally be larger.
*          To compute the optimal value of LWORK, call ILAENV to get
*          blocksizes (for DGEQRF, DORMQR, and DORGQR.)  Then compute:
*          NB  -- MAX of the blocksizes for DGEQRF, DORMQR, and DORGQR
*          The optimal LWORK is  2*N + N*(NB+1).
*
*          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
*          only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
*          this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
*          message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
*          = 1,...,N:
*                The QZ iteration failed.  (A,B) are not in Schur
*                form, but ALPHAR(j), ALPHAI(j), and BETA(j) should
*                be correct for j=INFO+1,...,N.
*          > N:  errors that usually indicate LAPACK problems:
*                =N+1: error return from DGGBAL

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE DGEGV( JOBVL, JOBVR, N, A, LDA, B, LDB, ALPHAR, ALPHAI, BETA, VL, LDVL, VR, LDVR, WORK, LWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  This routine is deprecated and has been replaced by routine DGGEV.
*
*  DGEGV computes the eigenvalues and, optionally, the left and/or right
*  eigenvectors of a real matrix pair (A,B).
*  Given two square matrices A and B,
*  the generalized nonsymmetric eigenvalue problem (GNEP) is to find the
*  eigenvalues lambda and corresponding (non-zero) eigenvectors x such
*  that
*
*     A*x = lambda*B*x.
*
*  An alternate form is to find the eigenvalues mu and corresponding
*  eigenvectors y such that
*
*     mu*A*y = B*y.
*
*  These two forms are equivalent with mu = 1/lambda and x = y if
*  neither lambda nor mu is zero.  In order to deal with the case that
*  lambda or mu is zero or small, two values alpha and beta are returned
*  for each eigenvalue, such that lambda = alpha/beta and
*  mu = beta/alpha.
*
*  The vectors x and y in the above equations are right eigenvectors of
*  the matrix pair (A,B).  Vectors u and v satisfying
*
*     u**H*A = lambda*u**H*B  or  mu*v**H*A = v**H*B
*
*  are left eigenvectors of (A,B).
*
*  Note: this routine performs "full balancing" on A and B -- see
*  "Further Details", below.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  JOBVL   (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'N':  do not compute the left generalized eigenvectors;
*          = 'V':  compute the left generalized eigenvectors (returned

*
*  JOBVR   (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'N':  do not compute the right generalized eigenvectors;
*          = 'V':  compute the right generalized eigenvectors (returned

*          contains the real Schur form of A from the generalized Schur
*          factorization of the pair (A,B) after balancing.
*          If no eigenvectors were computed, then only the diagonal
*          blocks from the Schur form will be correct.  See DGGHRD and
*          DHGEQZ for details.
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER

*          On entry, the matrix B.
*          If JOBVL = 'V' or JOBVR = 'V', then on exit B contains the
*          upper triangular matrix obtained from B in the generalized
*          Schur factorization of the pair (A,B) after balancing.
*          If no eigenvectors were computed, then only those elements of
*          B corresponding to the diagonal blocks from the Schur form of
*          A will be correct.  See DGGHRD and DHGEQZ for details.

*          eigenvalue of GNEP.  If ALPHAI(j) is zero, then the j-th
*          eigenvalue is real; if positive, then the j-th and

*  where [SIGMA] is an N-by-N (M-by-N) matrix which is zero except for its N
*  diagonal elements, [U] is an M-by-N (or M-by-M) orthonormal matrix, and
*  [V] is an N-by-N orthogonal matrix. The diagonal elements of [SIGMA] are
*  the singular values of [A]. The columns of [U] and [V] are the left and

*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  JOBA    (input) CHARACTER*1
*        Specifies the level of accuracy:
*       = 'C': This option works well (high relative accuracy) if A = B * D,
*             with well-conditioned B and arbitrary diagonal matrix D.
*             The accuracy cannot be spoiled by COLUMN scaling. The
*             accuracy of the computed output depends on the condition of
*             B, and the procedure aims at the best theoretical accuracy.
*             The relative error max_{i=1:N}|d sigma_i| / sigma_i is
*             bounded by f(M,N)*epsilon* cond(B), independent of D.
*             The input matrix is preprocessed with the QRF with column
*             pivoting. This initial preprocessing and preconditioning by
*             a rank revealing QR factorization is common for all values of
*             JOBA. Additional actions are specified as follows:
*       = 'E': Computation as with 'C' with an additional estimate of the
*             condition number of B. It provides a realistic error bound.
*       = 'F': If A = D1 * C * D2 with ill-conditioned diagonal scalings
*             D1, D2, and well-conditioned matrix C, this option gives
*             higher accuracy than the 'C' option. If the structure of the
*             input matrix is not known, and relative accuracy is
*             desirable, then this option is advisable. The input matrix A
*             is preprocessed with QR factorization with FULL (row and
*             column) pivoting.
*       = 'G'  Computation as with 'F' with an additional estimate of the
*             condition number of B, where A=D*B. If A has heavily weighted
*             rows, then using this condition number gives too pessimistic
*             error bound.
*       = 'A': Small singular values are the noise and the matrix is treated
*             as numerically rank defficient. The error in the computed
*             singular values is bounded by f(m,n)*epsilon*||A||.
*             The computed SVD A = U * S * V^t restores A up to
*             f(m,n)*epsilon*||A||.
*             This gives the procedure the licence to discard (set to zero)
*             all singular values below N*epsilon*||A||.
*       = 'R': Similar as in 'A'. Rank revealing property of the initial
*             QR factorization is used do reveal (using triangular factor)
*             a gap sigma_{r+1} < epsilon * sigma_r in which case the
*             numerical RANK is declared to be r. The SVD is computed with
*             absolute error bounds, but more accurately than with 'A'.
*
*  JOBU    (input) CHARACTER*1
*        Specifies whether to compute the columns of U:
*       = 'U': N columns of U are returned in the array U.
*       = 'F': full set of M left sing. vectors is returned in the array U.
*       = 'W': U may be used as workspace of length M*N. See the description
*             of U.
*       = 'N': U is not computed.
*
*  JOBV    (input) CHARACTER*1
*        Specifies whether to compute the matrix V:
*       = 'V': N columns of V are returned in the array V; Jacobi rotations
*             are not explicitly accumulated.
*       = 'J': N columns of V are returned in the array V, but they are
*             computed as the product of Jacobi rotations. This option is
*             allowed only if JOBU .NE. 'N', i.e. in computing the full SVD.
*       = 'W': V may be used as workspace of length N*N. See the description
*             of V.
*       = 'N': V is not computed.
*
*  JOBR    (input) CHARACTER*1
*        Specifies the RANGE for the singular values. Issues the licence to
*        set to zero small positive singular values if they are outside
*        specified range. If A .NE. 0 is scaled so that the largest singular
*        value of c*A is around DSQRT(BIG), BIG=SLAMCH('O'), then JOBR issues
*        the licence to kill columns of A whose norm in c*A is less than
*        DSQRT(SFMIN) (for JOBR.EQ.'R'), or less than SMALL=SFMIN/EPSLN,
*        where SFMIN=SLAMCH('S'), EPSLN=SLAMCH('E').
*       = 'N': Do not kill small columns of c*A. This option assumes that
*             BLAS and QR factorizations and triangular solvers are
*             implemented to work in that range. If the condition of A
*             is greater than BIG, use DGESVJ.
*       = 'R': RESTRICTED range for sigma(c*A) is [DSQRT(SFMIN), DSQRT(BIG)]
*             (roughly, as described above). This option is recommended.
*                                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*        For computing the singular values in the FULL range [SFMIN,BIG]
*        use DGESVJ.
*
*  JOBT    (input) CHARACTER*1
*        If the matrix is square then the procedure may determine to use
*        transposed A if A^t seems to be better with respect to convergence.
*        If the matrix is not square, JOBT is ignored. This is subject to
*        changes in the future.
*        The decision is based on two values of entropy over the adjoint
*        orbit of A^t * A. See the descriptions of WORK(6) and WORK(7).
*       = 'T': transpose if entropy test indicates possibly faster
*        convergence of Jacobi process if A^t is taken as input. If A is
*        replaced with A^t, then the row pivoting is included automatically.
*       = 'N': do not speculate.
*        This option can be used to compute only the singular values, or the
*        full SVD (U, SIGMA and V). For only one set of singular vectors
*        (U or V), the caller should provide both U and V, as one of the
*        matrices is used as workspace if the matrix A is transposed.
*        The implementer can easily remove this constraint and make the
*        code more complicated. See the descriptions of U and V.
*
*  JOBP    (input) CHARACTER*1
*        Issues the licence to introduce structured perturbations to drown
*        denormalized numbers. This licence should be active if the
*        denormals are poorly implemented, causing slow computation,
*        especially in cases of fast convergence (!). For details see [1,2].
*        For the sake of simplicity, this perturbations are included only
*        when the full SVD or only the singular values are requested. The
*        implementer/user can easily add the perturbation for the cases of
*        computing one set of singular vectors.
*       = 'P': introduce perturbation
*       = 'N': do not perturb
*
*  M       (input) INTEGER
*         The number of rows of the input matrix A.  M >= 0.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*         The number of columns of the input matrix A. M >= N >= 0.
*
*  A       (input/workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          On entry, the M-by-N matrix A.
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,M).
*
*  SVA     (workspace/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          On exit,
*          - For WORK(1)/WORK(2) = ONE: The singular values of A. During the
*            computation SVA contains Euclidean column norms of the
*            iterated matrices in the array A.
*          - For WORK(1) .NE. WORK(2): The singular values of A are
*            (WORK(1)/WORK(2)) * SVA(1:N). This factored form is used if
*            sigma_max(A) overflows or if small singular values have been
*            saved from underflow by scaling the input matrix A.
*          - If JOBR='R' then some of the singular values may be returned
*            as exact zeros obtained by "set to zero" because they are
*            below the numerical rank threshold or are denormalized numbers.
*
*  U       (workspace/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension ( LDU, N )
*          If JOBU = 'U', then U contains on exit the M-by-N matrix of
*                         the left singular vectors.
*          If JOBU = 'F', then U contains on exit the M-by-M matrix of
*                         the left singular vectors, including an ONB
*                         of the orthogonal complement of the Range(A).
*          If JOBU = 'W'  .AND. (JOBV.EQ.'V' .AND. JOBT.EQ.'T' .AND. M.EQ.N),
*                         then U is used as workspace if the procedure
*                         replaces A with A^t. In that case, [V] is computed
*                         in U as left singular vectors of A^t and then
*                         copied back to the V array. This 'W' option is just
*                         a reminder to the caller that in this case U is
*                         reserved as workspace of length N*N.
*          If JOBU = 'N'  U is not referenced.
*
* LDU      (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array U,  LDU >= 1.
*          IF  JOBU = 'U' or 'F' or 'W',  then LDU >= M.
*
*  V       (workspace/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension ( LDV, N )
*          If JOBV = 'V', 'J' then V contains on exit the N-by-N matrix of
*                         the right singular vectors;
*          If JOBV = 'W', AND (JOBU.EQ.'U' AND JOBT.EQ.'T' AND M.EQ.N),
*                         then V is used as workspace if the pprocedure
*                         replaces A with A^t. In that case, [U] is computed
*                         in V as right singular vectors of A^t and then
*                         copied back to the U array. This 'W' option is just
*                         a reminder to the caller that in this case V is
*                         reserved as workspace of length N*N.
*          If JOBV = 'N'  V is not referenced.
*
*  LDV     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array V,  LDV >= 1.
*          If JOBV = 'V' or 'J' or 'W', then LDV >= N.
*
*  WORK    (workspace/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension at least LWORK.
*          On exit,
*          WORK(1) = SCALE = WORK(2) / WORK(1) is the scaling factor such
*                    that SCALE*SVA(1:N) are the computed singular values
*                    of A. (See the description of SVA().)
*          WORK(2) = See the description of WORK(1).
*          WORK(3) = SCONDA is an estimate for the condition number of
*                    column equilibrated A. (If JOBA .EQ. 'E' or 'G')
*                    SCONDA is an estimate of DSQRT(||(R^t * R)^(-1)||_1).
*                    It is computed using DPOCON. It holds
*                    N^(-1/4) * SCONDA <= ||R^(-1)||_2 <= N^(1/4) * SCONDA
*                    where R is the triangular factor from the QRF of A.
*                    However, if R is truncated and the numerical rank is
*                    determined to be strictly smaller than N, SCONDA is
*                    returned as -1, thus indicating that the smallest
*                    singular values might be lost.
*
*          If full SVD is needed, the following two condition numbers are
*          useful for the analysis of the algorithm. They are provied for
*          a developer/implementer who is familiar with the details of
*          the method.
*
*          WORK(4) = an estimate of the scaled condition number of the
*                    triangular factor in the first QR factorization.
*          WORK(5) = an estimate of the scaled condition number of the
*                    triangular factor in the second QR factorization.
*          The following two parameters are computed if JOBT .EQ. 'T'.
*          They are provided for a developer/implementer who is familiar
*          with the details of the method.
*
*          WORK(6) = the entropy of A^t*A :: this is the Shannon entropy
*                    of diag(A^t*A) / Trace(A^t*A) taken as point in the
*                    probability simplex.
*          WORK(7) = the entropy of A*A^t.
*
*  LWORK   (input) INTEGER
*          Length of WORK to confirm proper allocation of work space.
*          LWORK depends on the job:
*
*          If only SIGMA is needed ( JOBU.EQ.'N', JOBV.EQ.'N' ) and
*            -> .. no scaled condition estimate required ( JOBE.EQ.'N'):
*               LWORK >= max(2*M+N,4*N+1,7). This is the minimal requirement.
*               For optimal performance (blocked code) the optimal value
*               is LWORK >= max(2*M+N,3*N+(N+1)*NB,7). Here NB is the optimal
*               block size for xGEQP3/xGEQRF.
*            -> .. an estimate of the scaled condition number of A is
*               required (JOBA='E', 'G'). In this case, LWORK is the maximum
*               of the above and N*N+4*N, i.e. LWORK >= max(2*M+N,N*N+4N,7).
*
*          If SIGMA and the right singular vectors are needed (JOBV.EQ.'V'),
*            -> the minimal requirement is LWORK >= max(2*N+M,7).
*            -> For optimal performance, LWORK >= max(2*N+M,2*N+N*NB,7),
*               where NB is the optimal block size.
*
*          If SIGMA and the left singular vectors are needed
*            -> the minimal requirement is LWORK >= max(2*N+M,7).
*            -> For optimal performance, LWORK >= max(2*N+M,2*N+N*NB,7),
*               where NB is the optimal block size.
*
*          If full SVD is needed ( JOBU.EQ.'U' or 'F', JOBV.EQ.'V' ) and
*            -> .. the singular vectors are computed without explicit
*               accumulation of the Jacobi rotations, LWORK >= 6*N+2*N*N
*            -> .. in the iterative part, the Jacobi rotations are
*               explicitly accumulated (option, see the description of JOBV),
*               then the minimal requirement is LWORK >= max(M+3*N+N*N,7).
*               For better performance, if NB is the optimal block size,
*               LWORK >= max(3*N+N*N+M,3*N+N*N+N*NB,7).
*
*  IWORK   (workspace/output) INTEGER array, dimension M+3*N.
*          On exit,
*          IWORK(1) = the numerical rank determined after the initial
*                     QR factorization with pivoting. See the descriptions
*                     of JOBA and JOBR.
*          IWORK(2) = the number of the computed nonzero singular values
*          IWORK(3) = if nonzero, a warning message:
*                     If IWORK(3).EQ.1 then some of the column norms of A
*                     were denormalized floats. The requested high accuracy
*                     is not warranted by the data.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*           < 0  : if INFO = -i, then the i-th argument had an illegal value.
*           = 0 :  successfull exit;

*                  of sweeps. The computed values may be inaccurate.
*

*  Further Details
*  ===============
*
*  DGEJSV implements a preconditioned Jacobi SVD algorithm. It uses SGEQP3,
*  SGEQRF, and SGELQF as preprocessors and preconditioners. Optionally, an
*  additional row pivoting can be used as a preprocessor, which in some
*  cases results in much higher accuracy. An example is matrix A with the
*  structure A = D1 * C * D2, where D1, D2 are arbitrarily ill-conditioned
*  diagonal matrices and C is well-conditioned matrix. In that case, complete
*  pivoting in the first QR factorizations provides accuracy dependent on the
*  condition number of C, and independent of D1, D2. Such higher accuracy is
*  not completely understood theoretically, but it works well in practice.
*  Further, if A can be written as A = B*D, with well-conditioned B and some
*  diagonal D, then the high accuracy is guaranteed, both theoretically and
*  in software, independent of D. For more details see [1], [2].
*     The computational range for the singular values can be the full range
*  ( UNDERFLOW,OVERFLOW ), provided that the machine arithmetic and the BLAS
*  & LAPACK routines called by DGEJSV are implemented to work in that range.
*  If that is not the case, then the restriction for safe computation with
*  the singular values in the range of normalized IEEE numbers is that the
*  spectral condition number kappa(A)=sigma_max(A)/sigma_min(A) does not
*  overflow. This code (DGEJSV) is best used in this restricted range,
*  meaning that singular values of magnitude below ||A||_2 / SLAMCH('O') are
*  returned as zeros. See JOBR for details on this.
*     Further, this implementation is somewhat slower than the one described
*  in [1,2] due to replacement of some non-LAPACK components, and because
*  the choice of some tuning parameters in the iterative part (DGESVJ) is
*  left to the implementer on a particular machine.
*     The rank revealing QR factorization (in this code: SGEQP3) should be
*  implemented as in [3]. We have a new version of SGEQP3 under development
*  that is more robust than the current one in LAPACK, with a cleaner cut in
*  rank defficient cases. It will be available in the SIGMA library [4].
*  If M is much larger than N, it is obvious that the inital QRF with
*  column pivoting can be preprocessed by the QRF without pivoting. That
*  well known trick is not used in DGEJSV because in some cases heavy row
*  weighting can be treated with complete pivoting. The overhead in cases
*  M much larger than N is then only due to pivoting, but the benefits in
*  terms of accuracy have prevailed. The implementer/user can incorporate
*  this extra QRF step easily. The implementer can also improve data movement
*  (matrix transpose, matrix copy, matrix transposed copy) - this
*  implementation of DGEJSV uses only the simplest, naive data movement.

*  involving an M-by-N matrix A, or its transpose, using a QR or LQ
*  factorization of A.  It is assumed that A has full rank.
*
*  The following options are provided:
*
*  1. If TRANS = 'N' and m >= n:  find the least squares solution of
*     an overdetermined system, i.e., solve the least squares problem
*                  minimize || B - A*X ||.
*
*  2. If TRANS = 'N' and m < n:  find the minimum norm solution of
*     an underdetermined system A * X = B.
*
*  3. If TRANS = 'T' and m >= n:  find the minimum norm solution of
*     an undetermined system A**T * X = B.
*
*  4. If TRANS = 'T' and m < n:  find the least squares solution of
*     an overdetermined system, i.e., solve the least squares problem
*                  minimize || B - A**T * X ||.
*
*  Several right hand side vectors b and solution vectors x can be
*  handled in a single call; they are stored as the columns of the

*          if TRANS = 'T'.
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, B is overwritten by the solution
*          vectors, stored columnwise:

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE DGELSD( M, N, NRHS, A, LDA, B, LDB, S, RCOND, RANK, WORK, LWORK, IWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DGELSD computes the minimum-norm solution to a real linear least
*  squares problem:
*      minimize 2-norm(| b - A*x |)
*  using the singular value decomposition (SVD) of A. A is an M-by-N
*  matrix which may be rank-deficient.
*
*  Several right hand side vectors b and solution vectors x can be
*  handled in a single call; they are stored as the columns of the
*  M-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B and the N-by-NRHS solution
*  matrix X.
*
*  The problem is solved in three steps:
*  (1) Reduce the coefficient matrix A to bidiagonal form with
*      Householder transformations, reducing the original problem
*      into a "bidiagonal least squares problem" (BLS)
*  (2) Solve the BLS using a divide and conquer approach.
*  (3) Apply back all the Householder tranformations to solve
*      the original least squares problem.
*
*  The effective rank of A is determined by treating as zero those
*  singular values which are less than RCOND times the largest singular
*  value.
*
*  The divide and conquer algorithm makes very mild assumptions about
*  floating point arithmetic. It will work on machines with a guard
*  digit in add/subtract, or on those binary machines without guard
*  digits which subtract like the Cray X-MP, Cray Y-MP, Cray C-90, or
*  Cray-2. It could conceivably fail on hexadecimal or decimal machines
*  without guard digits, but we know of none.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  M       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of rows of A. M >= 0.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of columns of A. N >= 0.
*
*  NRHS    (input) INTEGER
*          The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
*          of the matrices B and X. NRHS >= 0.
*
*  A       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          On entry, the M-by-N matrix A.
*          On exit, A has been destroyed.
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,M).
*
*  B       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
*          On entry, the M-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.
*          On exit, B is overwritten by the N-by-NRHS solution
*          matrix X.  If m >= n and RANK = n, the residual
*          sum-of-squares for the solution in the i-th column is given
*          by the sum of squares of elements n+1:m in that column.

*          The leading dimension of the array B. LDB >= max(1,max(M,N)).
*
*  S       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (min(M,N))
*          The singular values of A in decreasing order.
*          The condition number of A in the 2-norm = S(1)/S(min(m,n)).
*
*  RCOND   (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          RCOND is used to determine the effective rank of A.
*          Singular values S(i) <= RCOND*S(1) are treated as zero.
*          If RCOND < 0, machine precision is used instead.
*
*  RANK    (output) INTEGER
*          The effective rank of A, i.e., the number of singular values
*          which are greater than RCOND*S(1).
*
*  WORK    (workspace/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))

*
*  LWORK   (input) INTEGER
*          The dimension of the array WORK. LWORK must be at least 1.
*          The exact minimum amount of workspace needed depends on M,
*          N and NRHS. As long as LWORK is at least
*              12*N + 2*N*SMLSIZ + 8*N*NLVL + N*NRHS + (SMLSIZ+1)**2,
*          if M is greater than or equal to N or

*          if M is less than N, the code will execute correctly.
*          SMLSIZ is returned by ILAENV and is equal to the maximum
*          size of the subproblems at the bottom of the computation
*          tree (usually about 25), and
*             NLVL = MAX( 0, INT( LOG_2( MIN( M,N )/(SMLSIZ+1) ) ) + 1 )
*          For good performance, LWORK should generally be larger.

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE DGELSX( M, N, NRHS, A, LDA, B, LDB, JPVT, RCOND, RANK, WORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  This routine is deprecated and has been replaced by routine DGELSY.
*
*  DGELSX computes the minimum-norm solution to a real linear least
*  squares problem:
*      minimize || A * X - B ||
*  using a complete orthogonal factorization of A.  A is an M-by-N
*  matrix which may be rank-deficient.
*
*  Several right hand side vectors b and solution vectors x can be
*  handled in a single call; they are stored as the columns of the
*  M-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B and the N-by-NRHS solution
*  matrix X.
*
*  The routine first computes a QR factorization with column pivoting:
*      A * P = Q * [ R11 R12 ]
*                  [  0  R22 ]
*  with R11 defined as the largest leading submatrix whose estimated
*  condition number is less than 1/RCOND.  The order of R11, RANK,
*  is the effective rank of A.
*
*  Then, R22 is considered to be negligible, and R12 is annihilated
*  by orthogonal transformations from the right, arriving at the
*  complete orthogonal factorization:
*     A * P = Q * [ T11 0 ] * Z
*                 [  0  0 ]
*  The minimum-norm solution is then
*     X = P * Z' [ inv(T11)*Q1'*B ]
*                [        0       ]
*  where Q1 consists of the first RANK columns of Q.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========

*          On entry, the M-by-N matrix A.

*          On entry, the M-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.
*          On exit, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X.
*          If m >= n and RANK = n, the residual sum-of-squares for
*          the solution in the i-th column is given by the sum of
*          squares of elements N+1:M in that column.
*
*  LDB     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array B. LDB >= max(1,M,N).

*          On entry, if JPVT(i) .ne. 0, the i-th column of A is an
*          initial column, otherwise it is a free column.  Before
*          the QR factorization of A, all initial columns are
*          permuted to the leading positions; only the remaining
*          free columns are moved as a result of column pivoting
*          during the factorization.
*          On exit, if JPVT(i) = k, then the i-th column of A*P
*          was the k-th column of A.
*
*  RCOND   (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          RCOND is used to determine the effective rank of A, which
*          is defined as the order of the largest leading triangular
*          submatrix R11 in the QR factorization with pivoting of A,
*          whose estimated condition number < 1/RCOND.
*
*  RANK    (output) INTEGER
*          The effective rank of A, i.e., the order of the submatrix
*          R11.  This is the same as the order of the submatrix T11
*          in the complete orthogonal factorization of A.
*
*  WORK    (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension
*                      (max( min(M,N)+3*N, 2*min(M,N)+NRHS )),

*  where Q1 consists of the first RANK columns of Q.
*
*  This routine is basically identical to the original xGELSX except
*  three differences:
*    o The call to the subroutine xGEQPF has been substituted by the
*      the call to the subroutine xGEQP3. This subroutine is a Blas-3
*      version of the QR factorization with column pivoting.
*    o Matrix B (the right hand side) is updated with Blas-3.
*    o The permutation of matrix B (the right hand side) is faster and

USAGE:
  rcond, berr, err_bnds_norm, err_bnds_comp, info, x, params = NumRu::Lapack.dgerfsx( trans, equed, a, af, ipiv, r, c, b, x, params, [:usage => usage, :help => help])


FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE DGERFSX( TRANS, EQUED, N, NRHS, A, LDA, AF, LDAF, IPIV, R, C, B, LDB, X, LDX, RCOND, BERR, N_ERR_BNDS, ERR_BNDS_NORM, ERR_BNDS_COMP, NPARAMS, PARAMS, WORK, IWORK, INFO )

*     Purpose
*     =======
*
*     DGERFSX improves the computed solution to a system of linear
*     equations and provides error bounds and backward error estimates
*     for the solution.  In addition to normwise error bound, the code
*     provides maximum componentwise error bound if possible.  See
*     comments for ERR_BNDS_NORM and ERR_BNDS_COMP for details of the
*     error bounds.
*
*     The original system of linear equations may have been equilibrated
*     before calling this routine, as described by arguments EQUED, R
*     and C below. In this case, the solution and error bounds returned
*     are for the original unequilibrated system.
*

*     Arguments
*     =========
*
*     Some optional parameters are bundled in the PARAMS array.  These
*     settings determine how refinement is performed, but often the
*     defaults are acceptable.  If the defaults are acceptable, users
*     can pass NPARAMS = 0 which prevents the source code from accessing
*     the PARAMS argument.
*
*     TRANS   (input) CHARACTER*1
*     Specifies the form of the system of equations:
*       = 'N':  A * X = B     (No transpose)
*       = 'T':  A**T * X = B  (Transpose)
*       = 'C':  A**H * X = B  (Conjugate transpose = Transpose)
*
*     EQUED   (input) CHARACTER*1
*     Specifies the form of equilibration that was done to A
*     before calling this routine. This is needed to compute
*     the solution and error bounds correctly.
*       = 'N':  No equilibration
*       = 'R':  Row equilibration, i.e., A has been premultiplied by
*               diag(R).
*       = 'C':  Column equilibration, i.e., A has been postmultiplied
*               by diag(C).
*       = 'B':  Both row and column equilibration, i.e., A has been
*               replaced by diag(R) * A * diag(C).
*               The right hand side B has been changed accordingly.
*
*     N       (input) INTEGER
*     The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*     NRHS    (input) INTEGER
*     The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
*     of the matrices B and X.  NRHS >= 0.
*
*     A       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
*     The original N-by-N matrix A.
*
*     LDA     (input) INTEGER
*     The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
*
*     AF      (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDAF,N)
*     The factors L and U from the factorization A = P*L*U
*     as computed by DGETRF.
*
*     LDAF    (input) INTEGER
*     The leading dimension of the array AF.  LDAF >= max(1,N).
*
*     IPIV    (input) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*     The pivot indices from DGETRF; for 1<=i<=N, row i of the
*     matrix was interchanged with row IPIV(i).
*
*     R       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*     The row scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'R' or 'B', A is
*     multiplied on the left by diag(R); if EQUED = 'N' or 'C', R
*     is not accessed.  
*     If R is accessed, each element of R should be a power of the radix
*     to ensure a reliable solution and error estimates. Scaling by
*     powers of the radix does not cause rounding errors unless the
*     result underflows or overflows. Rounding errors during scaling
*     lead to refining with a matrix that is not equivalent to the
*     input matrix, producing error estimates that may not be
*     reliable.
*
*     C       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*     The column scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'C' or 'B', A is
*     multiplied on the right by diag(C); if EQUED = 'N' or 'R', C
*     is not accessed. 
*     If C is accessed, each element of C should be a power of the radix
*     to ensure a reliable solution and error estimates. Scaling by
*     powers of the radix does not cause rounding errors unless the
*     result underflows or overflows. Rounding errors during scaling
*     lead to refining with a matrix that is not equivalent to the
*     input matrix, producing error estimates that may not be
*     reliable.
*
*     B       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
*     The right hand side matrix B.
*
*     LDB     (input) INTEGER
*     The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
*
*     X       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
*     On entry, the solution matrix X, as computed by DGETRS.
*     On exit, the improved solution matrix X.
*
*     LDX     (input) INTEGER
*     The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
*
*     RCOND   (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*     Reciprocal scaled condition number.  This is an estimate of the
*     reciprocal Skeel condition number of the matrix A after
*     equilibration (if done).  If this is less than the machine
*     precision (in particular, if it is zero), the matrix is singular
*     to working precision.  Note that the error may still be small even
*     if this number is very small and the matrix appears ill-
*     conditioned.
*
*     BERR    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
*     Componentwise relative backward error.  This is the
*     componentwise relative backward error of each solution vector X(j)
*     (i.e., the smallest relative change in any element of A or B that
*     makes X(j) an exact solution).
*
*     N_ERR_BNDS (input) INTEGER
*     Number of error bounds to return for each right hand side
*     and each type (normwise or componentwise).  See ERR_BNDS_NORM and
*     ERR_BNDS_COMP below.
*
*     ERR_BNDS_NORM  (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
*     For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
*     various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
*     normwise relative error, which is defined as follows:
*
*     Normwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
*             max_j (abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i)))
*            ------------------------------
*                  max_j abs(X(j,i))
*
*     The array is indexed by the type of error information as described
*     below. There currently are up to three pieces of information
*     returned.
*
*     The first index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(i,:) corresponds to the ith
*     right-hand side.
*
*     The second index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,err) contains the following
*     three fields:
*     err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
*              reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
*              sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon').
*
*     err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
*              almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
*              so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
*              sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
*              be trusted if the previous boolean is true.
*
*     err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated normwise
*              reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
*              sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
*              estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
*              numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
*              appropriately scaled matrix Z.
*              Let Z = S*A, where S scales each row by a power of the
*              radix so all absolute row sums of Z are approximately 1.
*
*     See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
*     cautions.
*
*     ERR_BNDS_COMP  (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
*     For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
*     various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
*     componentwise relative error, which is defined as follows:
*
*     Componentwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
*                    abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i))
*             max_j ----------------------
*                         abs(X(j,i))
*
*     The array is indexed by the right-hand side i (on which the
*     componentwise relative error depends), and the type of error
*     information as described below. There currently are up to three
*     pieces of information returned for each right-hand side. If
*     componentwise accuracy is not requested (PARAMS(3) = 0.0), then
*     ERR_BNDS_COMP is not accessed.  If N_ERR_BNDS .LT. 3, then at most
*     the first (:,N_ERR_BNDS) entries are returned.
*
*     The first index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(i,:) corresponds to the ith
*     right-hand side.
*
*     The second index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,err) contains the following
*     three fields:
*     err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
*              reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
*              sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon').
*
*     err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
*              almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
*              so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
*              sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
*              be trusted if the previous boolean is true.
*
*     err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated componentwise
*              reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
*              sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
*              estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
*              numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
*              appropriately scaled matrix Z.
*              Let Z = S*(A*diag(x)), where x is the solution for the
*              current right-hand side and S scales each row of
*              A*diag(x) by a power of the radix so all absolute row
*              sums of Z are approximately 1.
*
*     See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
*     cautions.
*
*     NPARAMS (input) INTEGER
*     Specifies the number of parameters set in PARAMS.  If .LE. 0, the
*     PARAMS array is never referenced and default values are used.
*
*     PARAMS  (input / output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NPARAMS)
*     Specifies algorithm parameters.  If an entry is .LT. 0.0, then
*     that entry will be filled with default value used for that
*     parameter.  Only positions up to NPARAMS are accessed; defaults
*     are used for higher-numbered parameters.
*
*       PARAMS(LA_LINRX_ITREF_I = 1) : Whether to perform iterative
*            refinement or not.
*         Default: 1.0D+0
*            = 0.0 : No refinement is performed, and no error bounds are
*                    computed.
*            = 1.0 : Use the double-precision refinement algorithm,
*                    possibly with doubled-single computations if the
*                    compilation environment does not support DOUBLE
*                    PRECISION.
*              (other values are reserved for future use)
*
*       PARAMS(LA_LINRX_ITHRESH_I = 2) : Maximum number of residual
*            computations allowed for refinement.
*         Default: 10
*         Aggressive: Set to 100 to permit convergence using approximate
*                     factorizations or factorizations other than LU. If
*                     the factorization uses a technique other than
*                     Gaussian elimination, the guarantees in
*                     err_bnds_norm and err_bnds_comp may no longer be

*            will attempt to find a solution with small componentwise
*            relative error in the double-precision algorithm.  Positive

*       < 0:  If INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*       > 0 and <= N:  U(INFO,INFO) is exactly zero.  The factorization
*         has been completed, but the factor U is exactly singular, so
*         the solution and error bounds could not be computed. RCOND = 0
*         is returned.
*       = N+J: The solution corresponding to the Jth right-hand side is

*         hand sides K with K > J may not be guaranteed as well, but
*         only the first such right-hand side is reported. If a small

*         the Jth right-hand side is the first with a normwise error
*         bound that is not guaranteed (the smallest J such
*         that ERR_BNDS_NORM(J,1) = 0.0). By default (PARAMS(3) = 1.0)
*         the Jth right-hand side is the first with either a normwise or

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE DGESDD( JOBZ, M, N, A, LDA, S, U, LDU, VT, LDVT, WORK, LWORK, IWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DGESDD computes the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a real
*  M-by-N matrix A, optionally computing the left and right singular
*  vectors.  If singular vectors are desired, it uses a
*  divide-and-conquer algorithm.
*
*  The SVD is written
*
*       A = U * SIGMA * transpose(V)
*
*  where SIGMA is an M-by-N matrix which is zero except for its
*  min(m,n) diagonal elements, U is an M-by-M orthogonal matrix, and
*  V is an N-by-N orthogonal matrix.  The diagonal elements of SIGMA
*  are the singular values of A; they are real and non-negative, and
*  are returned in descending order.  The first min(m,n) columns of
*  U and V are the left and right singular vectors of A.
*
*  Note that the routine returns VT = V**T, not V.
*
*  The divide and conquer algorithm makes very mild assumptions about
*  floating point arithmetic. It will work on machines with a guard
*  digit in add/subtract, or on those binary machines without guard
*  digits which subtract like the Cray X-MP, Cray Y-MP, Cray C-90, or
*  Cray-2. It could conceivably fail on hexadecimal or decimal machines
*  without guard digits, but we know of none.

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE DGESVJ( JOBA, JOBU, JOBV, M, N, A, LDA, SVA, MV, V, LDV, WORK, LWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DGESVJ computes the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a real
*  M-by-N matrix A, where M >= N. The SVD of A is written as
*                                     [++]   [xx]   [x0]   [xx]
*               A = U * SIGMA * V^t,  [++] = [xx] * [ox] * [xx]
*                                     [++]   [xx]
*  where SIGMA is an N-by-N diagonal matrix, U is an M-by-N orthonormal
*  matrix, and V is an N-by-N orthogonal matrix. The diagonal elements
*  of SIGMA are the singular values of A. The columns of U and V are the
*  left and the right singular vectors of A, respectively.
*
*  Further Details
*  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*  The orthogonal N-by-N matrix V is obtained as a product of Jacobi plane
*  rotations. The rotations are implemented as fast scaled rotations of
*  Anda and Park [1]. In the case of underflow of the Jacobi angle, a
*  modified Jacobi transformation of Drmac [4] is used. Pivot strategy uses
*  column interchanges of de Rijk [2]. The relative accuracy of the computed
*  singular values and the accuracy of the computed singular vectors (in
*  angle metric) is as guaranteed by the theory of Demmel and Veselic [3].
*  The condition number that determines the accuracy in the full rank case
*  is essentially min_{D=diag} kappa(A*D), where kappa(.) is the
*  spectral condition number. The best performance of this Jacobi SVD
*  procedure is achieved if used in an  accelerated version of Drmac and
*  Veselic [5,6], and it is the kernel routine in the SIGMA library [7].
*  Some tunning parameters (marked with [TP]) are available for the
*  implementer.
*  The computational range for the nonzero singular values is the  machine
*  number interval ( UNDERFLOW , OVERFLOW ). In extreme cases, even
*  denormalized singular values can be computed with the corresponding
*  gradual loss of accurate digits.

*
*  JOBA    (input) CHARACTER* 1
*          Specifies the structure of A.
*          = 'L': The input matrix A is lower triangular;
*          = 'U': The input matrix A is upper triangular;
*          = 'G': The input matrix A is general M-by-N matrix, M >= N.
*
*  JOBU    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies whether to compute the left singular vectors
*          (columns of U):
*          = 'U': The left singular vectors corresponding to the nonzero
*                 singular values are computed and returned in the leading
*                 columns of A. See more details in the description of A.
*                 The default numerical orthogonality threshold is set to
*                 approximately TOL=CTOL*EPS, CTOL=DSQRT(M), EPS=DLAMCH('E').
*          = 'C': Analogous to JOBU='U', except that user can control the
*                 level of numerical orthogonality of the computed left
*                 singular vectors. TOL can be set to TOL = CTOL*EPS, where
*                 CTOL is given on input in the array WORK.
*                 No CTOL smaller than ONE is allowed. CTOL greater
*                 than 1 / EPS is meaningless. The option 'C'
*                 can be used if M*EPS is satisfactory orthogonality
*                 of the computed left singular vectors, so CTOL=M could
*                 save few sweeps of Jacobi rotations.
*                 See the descriptions of A and WORK(1).
*          = 'N': The matrix U is not computed. However, see the
*                 description of A.
*
*  JOBV    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies whether to compute the right singular vectors, that
*          is, the matrix V:
*          = 'V' : the matrix V is computed and returned in the array V
*          = 'A' : the Jacobi rotations are applied to the MV-by-N
*                  array V. In other words, the right singular vector
*                  matrix V is not computed explicitly, instead it is
*                  applied to an MV-by-N matrix initially stored in the
*                  first MV rows of V.
*          = 'N' : the matrix V is not computed and the array V is not
*                  referenced
*
*  M       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of rows of the input matrix A.  M >= 0.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of columns of the input matrix A.
*          M >= N >= 0.
*
*  A       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)

*                 If INFO .EQ. 0 :
*                 RANKA orthonormal columns of U are returned in the
*                 leading RANKA columns of the array A. Here RANKA <= N
*                 is the number of computed singular values of A that are
*                 above the underflow threshold DLAMCH('S'). The singular
*                 vectors corresponding to underflowed or zero singular
*                 values are not computed. The value of RANKA is returned
*                 in the array WORK as RANKA=NINT(WORK(2)). Also see the
*                 descriptions of SVA and WORK. The computed columns of U
*                 are mutually numerically orthogonal up to approximately
*                 TOL=DSQRT(M)*EPS (default); or TOL=CTOL*EPS (JOBU.EQ.'C'),
*                 see the description of JOBU.
*                 If INFO .GT. 0 :
*                 the procedure DGESVJ did not converge in the given number
*                 of iterations (sweeps). In that case, the computed
*                 columns of U may not be orthogonal up to TOL. The output
*                 U (stored in A), SIGMA (given by the computed singular
*                 values in SVA(1:N)) and V is still a decomposition of the
*                 input matrix A in the sense that the residual
*                 ||A-SCALE*U*SIGMA*V^T||_2 / ||A||_2 is small.
*
*          If JOBU .EQ. 'N' :
*                 If INFO .EQ. 0 :
*                 Note that the left singular vectors are 'for free' in the
*                 one-sided Jacobi SVD algorithm. However, if only the
*                 singular values are needed, the level of numerical
*                 orthogonality of U is not an issue and iterations are
*                 stopped when the columns of the iterated matrix are
*                 numerically orthogonal up to approximately M*EPS. Thus,
*                 on exit, A contains the columns of U scaled with the
*                 corresponding singular values.
*                 If INFO .GT. 0 :

*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,M).
*
*  SVA     (workspace/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          On exit :
*          If INFO .EQ. 0 :
*          depending on the value SCALE = WORK(1), we have:
*                 If SCALE .EQ. ONE :
*                 SVA(1:N) contains the computed singular values of A.
*                 During the computation SVA contains the Euclidean column
*                 norms of the iterated matrices in the array A.
*                 If SCALE .NE. ONE :
*                 The singular values of A are SCALE*SVA(1:N), and this
*                 factored representation is due to the fact that some of the
*                 singular values of A might underflow or overflow.
*          If INFO .GT. 0 :
*          the procedure DGESVJ did not converge in the given number of
*          iterations (sweeps) and SCALE*SVA(1:N) may not be accurate.
*
*  MV      (input) INTEGER
*          If JOBV .EQ. 'A', then the product of Jacobi rotations in DGESVJ
*          is applied to the first MV rows of V. See the description of JOBV.
*
*  V       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDV,N)
*          If JOBV = 'V', then V contains on exit the N-by-N matrix of
*                         the right singular vectors;
*          If JOBV = 'A', then V contains the product of the computed right
*                         singular vector matrix and the initial matrix in
*                         the array V.
*          If JOBV = 'N', then V is not referenced.
*
*  LDV     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array V, LDV .GE. 1.
*          If JOBV .EQ. 'V', then LDV .GE. max(1,N).
*          If JOBV .EQ. 'A', then LDV .GE. max(1,MV) .
*
*  WORK    (input/workspace/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension max(4,M+N).
*          On entry :
*          If JOBU .EQ. 'C' :
*          WORK(1) = CTOL, where CTOL defines the threshold for convergence.
*                    The process stops if all columns of A are mutually
*                    orthogonal up to CTOL*EPS, EPS=DLAMCH('E').
*                    It is required that CTOL >= ONE, i.e. it is not
*                    allowed to force the routine to obtain orthogonality
*                    below EPS.
*          On exit :
*          WORK(1) = SCALE is the scaling factor such that SCALE*SVA(1:N)
*                    are the computed singular values of A.
*                    (See description of SVA().)
*          WORK(2) = NINT(WORK(2)) is the number of the computed nonzero
*                    singular values.
*          WORK(3) = NINT(WORK(3)) is the number of the computed singular

*                    This is useful information in cases when DGESVJ did
*                    not converge, as it can be used to estimate whether
*                    the output is stil useful and for post festum analysis.
*          WORK(6) = the largest absolute value over all sines of the
*                    Jacobi rotation angles in the last sweep. It can be
*                    useful for a post festum analysis.

USAGE:
  x, rcond, ferr, berr, work, info, a, af, ipiv, equed, r, c, b = NumRu::Lapack.dgesvx( fact, trans, a, af, ipiv, equed, r, c, b, [:usage => usage, :help => help])


FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE DGESVX( FACT, TRANS, N, NRHS, A, LDA, AF, LDAF, IPIV, EQUED, R, C, B, LDB, X, LDX, RCOND, FERR, BERR, WORK, IWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DGESVX uses the LU factorization to compute the solution to a real
*  system of linear equations
*     A * X = B,
*  where A is an N-by-N matrix and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.
*
*  Error bounds on the solution and a condition estimate are also
*  provided.
*
*  Description
*  ===========
*
*  The following steps are performed:
*
*  1. If FACT = 'E', real scaling factors are computed to equilibrate
*     the system:
*        TRANS = 'N':  diag(R)*A*diag(C)     *inv(diag(C))*X = diag(R)*B
*        TRANS = 'T': (diag(R)*A*diag(C))**T *inv(diag(R))*X = diag(C)*B
*        TRANS = 'C': (diag(R)*A*diag(C))**H *inv(diag(R))*X = diag(C)*B
*     Whether or not the system will be equilibrated depends on the
*     scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, A is
*     overwritten by diag(R)*A*diag(C) and B by diag(R)*B (if TRANS='N')
*     or diag(C)*B (if TRANS = 'T' or 'C').
*
*  2. If FACT = 'N' or 'E', the LU decomposition is used to factor the
*     matrix A (after equilibration if FACT = 'E') as
*        A = P * L * U,
*     where P is a permutation matrix, L is a unit lower triangular
*     matrix, and U is upper triangular.
*
*  3. If some U(i,i)=0, so that U is exactly singular, then the routine
*     returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored form of A is used
*     to estimate the condition number of the matrix A.  If the
*     reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine precision,
*     INFO = N+1 is returned as a warning, but the routine still goes on
*     to solve for X and compute error bounds as described below.
*
*  4. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
*     of A.
*
*  5. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution
*     matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates
*     for it.
*
*  6. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by
*     diag(C) (if TRANS = 'N') or diag(R) (if TRANS = 'T' or 'C') so
*     that it solves the original system before equilibration.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  FACT    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies whether or not the factored form of the matrix A is
*          supplied on entry, and if not, whether the matrix A should be
*          equilibrated before it is factored.
*          = 'F':  On entry, AF and IPIV contain the factored form of A.
*                  If EQUED is not 'N', the matrix A has been
*                  equilibrated with scaling factors given by R and C.
*                  A, AF, and IPIV are not modified.
*          = 'N':  The matrix A will be copied to AF and factored.
*          = 'E':  The matrix A will be equilibrated if necessary, then
*                  copied to AF and factored.
*
*  TRANS   (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies the form of the system of equations:
*          = 'N':  A * X = B     (No transpose)
*          = 'T':  A**T * X = B  (Transpose)

*          If INFO = 0 or INFO = N+1, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X
*          to the original system of equations.  Note that A and B are
*          modified on exit if EQUED .ne. 'N', and the solution to the

*
*  RCOND   (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The estimate of the reciprocal condition number of the matrix
*          A after equilibration (if done).  If RCOND is less than the
*          machine precision (in particular, if RCOND = 0), the matrix
*          is singular to working precision.  This condition is
*          indicated by a return code of INFO > 0.
*
*  FERR    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
*          The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
*          X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
*          If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
*          is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
*          element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
*          largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
*          the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight
*          overestimate of the true error.
*
*  BERR    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
*          The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
*          vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
*          any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).
*
*  WORK    (workspace/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (4*N)
*          On exit, WORK(1) contains the reciprocal pivot growth
*          factor norm(A)/norm(U). The "max absolute element" norm is
*          used. If WORK(1) is much less than 1, then the stability
*          of the LU factorization of the (equilibrated) matrix A
*          could be poor. This also means that the solution X, condition
*          estimator RCOND, and forward error bound FERR could be
*          unreliable. If factorization fails with 0<INFO<=N, then
*          WORK(1) contains the reciprocal pivot growth factor for the
*          leading INFO columns of A.
*
*  IWORK   (workspace) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0:  if INFO = i, and i is
*                <= N:  U(i,i) is exactly zero.  The factorization has
*                       been completed, but the factor U is exactly
*                       singular, so the solution and error bounds
*                       could not be computed. RCOND = 0 is returned.
*                = N+1: U is nonsingular, but RCOND is less than machine
*                       precision, meaning that the matrix is singular
*                       to working precision.  Nevertheless, the
*                       solution and error bounds are computed because
*                       there are a number of situations where the
*                       computed solution can be more accurate than the
*                       value of RCOND would suggest.

*     Purpose
*     =======
*
*     DGESVXX uses the LU factorization to compute the solution to a
*     double precision system of linear equations  A * X = B,  where A is an
*     N-by-N matrix and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.
*
*     If requested, both normwise and maximum componentwise error bounds
*     are returned. DGESVXX will return a solution with a tiny
*     guaranteed error (O(eps) where eps is the working machine
*     precision) unless the matrix is very ill-conditioned, in which
*     case a warning is returned. Relevant condition numbers also are
*     calculated and returned.
*
*     DGESVXX accepts user-provided factorizations and equilibration
*     factors; see the definitions of the FACT and EQUED options.
*     Solving with refinement and using a factorization from a previous
*     DGESVXX call will also produce a solution with either O(eps)
*     errors or warnings, but we cannot make that claim for general
*     user-provided factorizations and equilibration factors if they
*     differ from what DGESVXX would itself produce.
*
*     Description
*     ===========
*
*     The following steps are performed:
*
*     1. If FACT = 'E', double precision scaling factors are computed to equilibrate
*     the system:
*
*       TRANS = 'N':  diag(R)*A*diag(C)     *inv(diag(C))*X = diag(R)*B
*       TRANS = 'T': (diag(R)*A*diag(C))**T *inv(diag(R))*X = diag(C)*B
*       TRANS = 'C': (diag(R)*A*diag(C))**H *inv(diag(R))*X = diag(C)*B
*
*     Whether or not the system will be equilibrated depends on the
*     scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, A is
*     overwritten by diag(R)*A*diag(C) and B by diag(R)*B (if TRANS='N')
*     or diag(C)*B (if TRANS = 'T' or 'C').
*
*     2. If FACT = 'N' or 'E', the LU decomposition is used to factor
*     the matrix A (after equilibration if FACT = 'E') as
*
*       A = P * L * U,
*
*     where P is a permutation matrix, L is a unit lower triangular
*     matrix, and U is upper triangular.
*
*     3. If some U(i,i)=0, so that U is exactly singular, then the
*     routine returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored form of A
*     is used to estimate the condition number of the matrix A (see
*     argument RCOND). If the reciprocal of the condition number is less
*     than machine precision, the routine still goes on to solve for X
*     and compute error bounds as described below.
*
*     4. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
*     of A.
*
*     5. By default (unless PARAMS(LA_LINRX_ITREF_I) is set to zero),
*     the routine will use iterative refinement to try to get a small
*     error and error bounds.  Refinement calculates the residual to at
*     least twice the working precision.
*
*     6. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by
*     diag(C) (if TRANS = 'N') or diag(R) (if TRANS = 'T' or 'C') so
*     that it solves the original system before equilibration.
*

*     Arguments
*     =========
*
*     Some optional parameters are bundled in the PARAMS array.  These
*     settings determine how refinement is performed, but often the
*     defaults are acceptable.  If the defaults are acceptable, users
*     can pass NPARAMS = 0 which prevents the source code from accessing
*     the PARAMS argument.
*
*     FACT    (input) CHARACTER*1
*     Specifies whether or not the factored form of the matrix A is
*     supplied on entry, and if not, whether the matrix A should be
*     equilibrated before it is factored.
*       = 'F':  On entry, AF and IPIV contain the factored form of A.
*               If EQUED is not 'N', the matrix A has been
*               equilibrated with scaling factors given by R and C.
*               A, AF, and IPIV are not modified.
*       = 'N':  The matrix A will be copied to AF and factored.

*       = 'T':  A**T * X = B  (Transpose)
*       = 'C':  A**H * X = B  (Conjugate Transpose = Transpose)

*     matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*     NRHS    (input) INTEGER
*     The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
*     of the matrices B and X.  NRHS >= 0.
*
*     A       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
*     On entry, the N-by-N matrix A.  If FACT = 'F' and EQUED is
*     not 'N', then A must have been equilibrated by the scaling
*     factors in R and/or C.  A is not modified if FACT = 'F' or
*     'N', or if FACT = 'E' and EQUED = 'N' on exit.
*
*     On exit, if EQUED .ne. 'N', A is scaled as follows:
*     EQUED = 'R':  A := diag(R) * A
*     EQUED = 'C':  A := A * diag(C)
*     EQUED = 'B':  A := diag(R) * A * diag(C).
*
*     LDA     (input) INTEGER

*
*     AF      (input or output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDAF,N)
*     If FACT = 'F', then AF is an input argument and on entry
*     contains the factors L and U from the factorization
*     A = P*L*U as computed by DGETRF.  If EQUED .ne. 'N', then
*     AF is the factored form of the equilibrated matrix A.
*
*     If FACT = 'N', then AF is an output argument and on exit
*     returns the factors L and U from the factorization A = P*L*U
*     of the original matrix A.
*
*     If FACT = 'E', then AF is an output argument and on exit
*     returns the factors L and U from the factorization A = P*L*U
*     of the equilibrated matrix A (see the description of A for
*     the form of the equilibrated matrix).

*     If FACT = 'F', then IPIV is an input argument and on entry
*     contains the pivot indices from the factorization A = P*L*U
*     as computed by DGETRF; row i of the matrix was interchanged
*     with row IPIV(i).
*
*     If FACT = 'N', then IPIV is an output argument and on exit
*     contains the pivot indices from the factorization A = P*L*U
*     of the original matrix A.
*
*     If FACT = 'E', then IPIV is an output argument and on exit
*     contains the pivot indices from the factorization A = P*L*U
*     of the equilibrated matrix A.
*
*     EQUED   (input or output) CHARACTER*1
*     Specifies the form of equilibration that was done.
*       = 'N':  No equilibration (always true if FACT = 'N').
*       = 'R':  Row equilibration, i.e., A has been premultiplied by
*               diag(R).
*       = 'C':  Column equilibration, i.e., A has been postmultiplied
*               by diag(C).
*       = 'B':  Both row and column equilibration, i.e., A has been
*               replaced by diag(R) * A * diag(C).
*     EQUED is an input argument if FACT = 'F'; otherwise, it is an
*     output argument.
*
*     R       (input or output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*     The row scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'R' or 'B', A is
*     multiplied on the left by diag(R); if EQUED = 'N' or 'C', R
*     is not accessed.  R is an input argument if FACT = 'F';
*     otherwise, R is an output argument.  If FACT = 'F' and
*     EQUED = 'R' or 'B', each element of R must be positive.
*     If R is output, each element of R is a power of the radix.
*     If R is input, each element of R should be a power of the radix
*     to ensure a reliable solution and error estimates. Scaling by
*     powers of the radix does not cause rounding errors unless the
*     result underflows or overflows. Rounding errors during scaling
*     lead to refining with a matrix that is not equivalent to the
*     input matrix, producing error estimates that may not be
*     reliable.
*
*     C       (input or output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*     The column scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'C' or 'B', A is
*     multiplied on the right by diag(C); if EQUED = 'N' or 'R', C
*     is not accessed.  C is an input argument if FACT = 'F';
*     otherwise, C is an output argument.  If FACT = 'F' and
*     EQUED = 'C' or 'B', each element of C must be positive.
*     If C is output, each element of C is a power of the radix.
*     If C is input, each element of C should be a power of the radix
*     to ensure a reliable solution and error estimates. Scaling by
*     powers of the radix does not cause rounding errors unless the
*     result underflows or overflows. Rounding errors during scaling
*     lead to refining with a matrix that is not equivalent to the
*     input matrix, producing error estimates that may not be
*     reliable.
*
*     B       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
*     On entry, the N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.
*     On exit,
*     if EQUED = 'N', B is not modified;
*     if TRANS = 'N' and EQUED = 'R' or 'B', B is overwritten by
*        diag(R)*B;
*     if TRANS = 'T' or 'C' and EQUED = 'C' or 'B', B is
*        overwritten by diag(C)*B.
*
*     LDB     (input) INTEGER
*     The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
*
*     X       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
*     If INFO = 0, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X to the original
*     system of equations.  Note that A and B are modified on exit
*     if EQUED .ne. 'N', and the solution to the equilibrated system is
*     inv(diag(C))*X if TRANS = 'N' and EQUED = 'C' or 'B', or
*     inv(diag(R))*X if TRANS = 'T' or 'C' and EQUED = 'R' or 'B'.
*
*     LDX     (input) INTEGER
*     The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
*
*     RCOND   (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*     Reciprocal scaled condition number.  This is an estimate of the
*     reciprocal Skeel condition number of the matrix A after
*     equilibration (if done).  If this is less than the machine
*     precision (in particular, if it is zero), the matrix is singular
*     to working precision.  Note that the error may still be small even
*     if this number is very small and the matrix appears ill-
*     conditioned.
*
*     RPVGRW  (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*     Reciprocal pivot growth.  On exit, this contains the reciprocal
*     pivot growth factor norm(A)/norm(U). The "max absolute element"
*     norm is used.  If this is much less than 1, then the stability of
*     the LU factorization of the (equilibrated) matrix A could be poor.
*     This also means that the solution X, estimated condition numbers,
*     and error bounds could be unreliable. If factorization fails with
*     0<INFO<=N, then this contains the reciprocal pivot growth factor
*     for the leading INFO columns of A.  In DGESVX, this quantity is
*     returned in WORK(1).
*
*     BERR    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)

*
*     N_ERR_BNDS (input) INTEGER

*
*     The array is indexed by the type of error information as described

*
*     The first index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(i,:) corresponds to the ith

*          If U(k, k) appears to be less than SMIN, U(k, k) is given the
