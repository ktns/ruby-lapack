      SUBROUTINE STRCON( NORM, UPLO, DIAG, N, A, LDA, RCOND, WORK, IWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  STRCON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number of a
*  triangular matrix A, in either the 1-norm or the infinity-norm.
*
*  The norm of A is computed and an estimate is obtained for
*  norm(inv(A)), then the reciprocal of the condition number is
*  computed as
*     RCOND = 1 / ( norm(A) * norm(inv(A)) ).
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  NORM    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies whether the 1-norm condition number or the
*          infinity-norm condition number is required:
*          = '1' or 'O':  1-norm;

*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1

*
*  A       (input) REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)

*          upper triangular part of the array A contains the upper
*          triangular matrix, and the strictly lower triangular part of
*          A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the leading N-by-N lower
*          triangular part of the array A contains the lower triangular
*          matrix, and the strictly upper triangular part of A is not
*          referenced.  If DIAG = 'U', the diagonal elements of A are

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE STREVC( SIDE, HOWMNY, SELECT, N, T, LDT, VL, LDVL, VR, LDVR, MM, M, WORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  STREVC computes some or all of the right and/or left eigenvectors of
*  a real upper quasi-triangular matrix T.
*  Matrices of this type are produced by the Schur factorization of
*  a real general matrix:  A = Q*T*Q**T, as computed by SHSEQR.
*  
*  The right eigenvector x and the left eigenvector y of T corresponding
*  to an eigenvalue w are defined by:
*  
*     T*x = w*x,     (y**H)*T = w*(y**H)
*  
*  where y**H denotes the conjugate transpose of y.
*  The eigenvalues are not input to this routine, but are read directly
*  from the diagonal blocks of T.
*  
*  This routine returns the matrices X and/or Y of right and left
*  eigenvectors of T, or the products Q*X and/or Q*Y, where Q is an
*  input matrix.  If Q is the orthogonal factor that reduces a matrix
*  A to Schur form T, then Q*X and Q*Y are the matrices of right and
*  left eigenvectors of A.

*          of Schur vectors returned by SHSEQR).
*          On exit, if SIDE = 'L' or 'B', VL contains:
*          if HOWMNY = 'A', the matrix Y of left eigenvectors of T;
*          if HOWMNY = 'B', the matrix Q*Y;
*          if HOWMNY = 'S', the left eigenvectors of T specified by

*                           eigenvalues.
*          A complex eigenvector corresponding to a complex eigenvalue
*          is stored in two consecutive columns, the first holding the
*          real part, and the second the imaginary part.
*          Not referenced if SIDE = 'R'.

*          A complex eigenvector corresponding to a complex eigenvalue
*          is stored in two consecutive columns, the first holding the
*          real part and the second the imaginary part.
*          Not referenced if SIDE = 'L'.

*

*  Further Details
*  ===============
*
*  The algorithm used in this program is basically backward (forward)
*  substitution, with scaling to make the the code robust against
*  possible overflow.
*
*  Each eigenvector is normalized so that the element of largest
*  magnitude has magnitude 1; here the magnitude of a complex number
*  (x,y) is taken to be |x| + |y|.

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE STREXC( COMPQ, N, T, LDT, Q, LDQ, IFST, ILST, WORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  STREXC reorders the real Schur factorization of a real matrix
*  A = Q*T*Q**T, so that the diagonal block of T with row index IFST is
*  moved to row ILST.
*
*  The real Schur form T is reordered by an orthogonal similarity
*  transformation Z**T*T*Z, and optionally the matrix Q of Schur vectors
*  is updated by postmultiplying it with Z.
*
*  T must be in Schur canonical form (as returned by SHSEQR), that is,
*  block upper triangular with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks; each
*  2-by-2 diagonal block has its diagonal elements equal and its
*  off-diagonal elements of opposite sign.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========

*          On exit, if COMPQ = 'V', Q has been postmultiplied by the

*          If COMPQ = 'N', Q is not referenced.
*
*  LDQ     (input) INTEGER

*
*  IFST    (input/output) INTEGER
*  ILST    (input/output) INTEGER
*          Specify the reordering of the diagonal blocks of T.
*          The block with row index IFST is moved to row ILST, by a
*          sequence of transpositions between adjacent blocks.
*          On exit, if IFST pointed on entry to the second row of a
*          2-by-2 block, it is changed to point to the first row; ILST
*          always points to the first row of the block in its final
*          position (which may differ from its input value by +1 or -1).
*          1 <= IFST <= N; 1 <= ILST <= N.
*
*  WORK    (workspace) REAL array, dimension (N)
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          = 1:  two adjacent blocks were too close to swap (the problem
*                is very ill-conditioned); T may have been partially
*                reordered, and ILST points to the first row of the
*                current position of the block being moved.

*          The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
*          X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
*          If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
*          is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest

*
*  BERR    (output) REAL array, dimension (NRHS)

*          WI(i+1) = -WI(i). Note that if a complex eigenvalue is

*

*  Further Details
*  ===============
*
*  STRSEN first collects the selected eigenvalues by computing an
*  orthogonal transformation Z to move them to the top left corner of T.
*  In other words, the selected eigenvalues are the eigenvalues of T11
*  in:
*
*                Z'*T*Z = ( T11 T12 ) n1
*                         (  0  T22 ) n2
*                            n1  n2
*
*  where N = n1+n2 and Z' means the transpose of Z. The first n1 columns
*  of Z span the specified invariant subspace of T.
*
*  If T has been obtained from the real Schur factorization of a matrix
*  A = Q*T*Q', then the reordered real Schur factorization of A is given
*  by A = (Q*Z)*(Z'*T*Z)*(Q*Z)', and the first n1 columns of Q*Z span
*  the corresponding invariant subspace of A.
*
*  The reciprocal condition number of the average of the eigenvalues of
*  T11 may be returned in S. S lies between 0 (very badly conditioned)
*  and 1 (very well conditioned). It is computed as follows. First we
*  compute R so that
*
*                         P = ( I  R ) n1
*                             ( 0  0 ) n2
*                               n1 n2
*
*  is the projector on the invariant subspace associated with T11.
*  R is the solution of the Sylvester equation:
*
*                        T11*R - R*T22 = T12.
*
*  Let F-norm(M) denote the Frobenius-norm of M and 2-norm(M) denote
*  the two-norm of M. Then S is computed as the lower bound
*
*                      (1 + F-norm(R)**2)**(-1/2)
*
*  on the reciprocal of 2-norm(P), the true reciprocal condition number.
*  S cannot underestimate 1 / 2-norm(P) by more than a factor of
*  sqrt(N).
*
*  An approximate error bound for the computed average of the
*  eigenvalues of T11 is
*
*                         EPS * norm(T) / S
*
*  where EPS is the machine precision.
*
*  The reciprocal condition number of the right invariant subspace
*  spanned by the first n1 columns of Z (or of Q*Z) is returned in SEP.
*  SEP is defined as the separation of T11 and T22:
*
*                     sep( T11, T22 ) = sigma-min( C )
*
*  where sigma-min(C) is the smallest singular value of the
*  n1*n2-by-n1*n2 matrix
*
*     C  = kprod( I(n2), T11 ) - kprod( transpose(T22), I(n1) )
*
*  I(m) is an m by m identity matrix, and kprod denotes the Kronecker
*  product. We estimate sigma-min(C) by the reciprocal of an estimate of
*  the 1-norm of inverse(C). The true reciprocal 1-norm of inverse(C)
*  cannot differ from sigma-min(C) by more than a factor of sqrt(n1*n2).
*
*  When SEP is small, small changes in T can cause large changes in
*  the invariant subspace. An approximate bound on the maximum angular
*  error in the computed right invariant subspace is
*
*                      EPS * norm(T) / SEP

*          If JOB = 'E' or 'B', the reciprocal condition numbers of the
*          selected eigenvalues, stored in consecutive elements of the
*          array. For a complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues two

*

*  Further Details
*  ===============
*
*  The reciprocal of the condition number of an eigenvalue lambda is
*  defined as
*
*          S(lambda) = |v'*u| / (norm(u)*norm(v))
*
*  where u and v are the right and left eigenvectors of T corresponding
*  to lambda; v' denotes the conjugate-transpose of v, and norm(u)
*  denotes the Euclidean norm. These reciprocal condition numbers always
*  lie between zero (very badly conditioned) and one (very well
*  conditioned). If n = 1, S(lambda) is defined to be 1.
*
*  An approximate error bound for a computed eigenvalue W(i) is given by
*
*                      EPS * norm(T) / S(i)
*
*  where EPS is the machine precision.
*
*  The reciprocal of the condition number of the right eigenvector u
*  corresponding to lambda is defined as follows. Suppose
*
*              T = ( lambda  c  )
*                  (   0    T22 )
*
*  Then the reciprocal condition number is
*
*          SEP( lambda, T22 ) = sigma-min( T22 - lambda*I )
*
*  where sigma-min denotes the smallest singular value. We approximate
*  the smallest singular value by the reciprocal of an estimate of the
*  one-norm of the inverse of T22 - lambda*I. If n = 1, SEP(1) is
*  defined to be abs(T(1,1)).
*
*  An approximate error bound for a computed right eigenvector VR(i)
*  is given by
*
*                      EPS * norm(T) / SEP(i)

      SUBROUTINE STRTRS( UPLO, TRANS, DIAG, N, NRHS, A, LDA, B, LDB, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  STRTRS solves a triangular system of the form
*
*     A * X = B  or  A**T * X = B,
*
*  where A is a triangular matrix of order N, and B is an N-by-NRHS
*  matrix.  A check is made to verify that A is nonsingular.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U':  A is upper triangular;
*          = 'L':  A is lower triangular.
*
*  TRANS   (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies the form of the system of equations:
*          = 'N':  A * X = B  (No transpose)
*          = 'T':  A**T * X = B  (Transpose)
*          = 'C':  A**H * X = B  (Conjugate transpose = Transpose)
*
*  DIAG    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'N':  A is non-unit triangular;
*          = 'U':  A is unit triangular.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  NRHS    (input) INTEGER
*          The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
*          of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.
*
*  A       (input) REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          The triangular matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading N-by-N
*          upper triangular part of the array A contains the upper
*          triangular matrix, and the strictly lower triangular part of
*          A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the leading N-by-N lower
*          triangular part of the array A contains the lower triangular
*          matrix, and the strictly upper triangular part of A is not
*          referenced.  If DIAG = 'U', the diagonal elements of A are
*          also not referenced and are assumed to be 1.
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
*
*  B       (input/output) REAL array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
*          On entry, the right hand side matrix B.
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, the solution matrix X.
*
*  LDB     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0: if INFO = i, the i-th diagonal element of A is zero,
*               indicating that the matrix is singular and the solutions
*               X have not been computed.

*  Further Details
*  ===============
*
*  We first consider Rectangular Full Packed (RFP) Format when N is
*  even. We give an example where N = 6.
*
*      AP is Upper             AP is Lower

*                  55       50 51 52 53 54 55
*
*
*  Let TRANSR = 'N'. RFP holds AP as follows:
*  For UPLO = 'U' the upper trapezoid A(0:5,0:2) consists of the last
*  three columns of AP upper. The lower triangle A(4:6,0:2) consists of
*  the transpose of the first three columns of AP upper.
*  For UPLO = 'L' the lower trapezoid A(1:6,0:2) consists of the first
*  three columns of AP lower. The upper triangle A(0:2,0:2) consists of
*  the transpose of the last three columns of AP lower.
*  This covers the case N even and TRANSR = 'N'.
*
*         RFP A                   RFP A

*
*  Now let TRANSR = 'T'. RFP A in both UPLO cases is just the
*  transpose of RFP A above. One therefore gets:
