FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE CPPCON( UPLO, N, AP, ANORM, RCOND, WORK, RWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  CPPCON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number (in the 
*  1-norm) of a complex Hermitian positive definite packed matrix using
*  the Cholesky factorization A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H computed by
*  CPPTRF.
*
*  An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the
*  condition number is computed as RCOND = 1 / (ANORM * norm(inv(A))).
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;

*          A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H, packed columnwise in a linear
*          array.  The j-th column of U or L is stored in the array AP
*          as follows:
*          if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = U(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
*          if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2n-j)/2) = L(i,j) for j<=i<=n.

*          computed as RCOND = 1/(ANORM * AINVNM), where AINVNM is an
*          estimate of the 1-norm of inv(A) computed in this routine.

*
*  RWORK   (workspace) REAL array, dimension (N)

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE CPPEQU( UPLO, N, AP, S, SCOND, AMAX, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  CPPEQU computes row and column scalings intended to equilibrate a
*  Hermitian positive definite matrix A in packed storage and reduce
*  its condition number (with respect to the two-norm).  S contains the
*  scale factors, S(i)=1/sqrt(A(i,i)), chosen so that the scaled matrix
*  B with elements B(i,j)=S(i)*A(i,j)*S(j) has ones on the diagonal.
*  This choice of S puts the condition number of B within a factor N of
*  the smallest possible condition number over all possible diagonal
*  scalings.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
*          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.

*          if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
*          if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.

*          If INFO = 0, S contains the scale factors for A.
*
*  SCOND   (output) REAL
*          If INFO = 0, S contains the ratio of the smallest S(i) to
*          the largest S(i).  If SCOND >= 0.1 and AMAX is neither too
*          large nor too small, it is not worth scaling by S.
*
*  AMAX    (output) REAL
*          Absolute value of largest matrix element.  If AMAX is very
*          close to overflow or very close to underflow, the matrix
*          should be scaled.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit

*  ===============
*
*  The packed storage scheme is illustrated by the following example

  Solves a Hermitian positive definite system of linear

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE CPPSVX( FACT, UPLO, N, NRHS, AP, AFP, EQUED, S, B, LDB, X, LDX, RCOND, FERR, BERR, WORK, RWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  CPPSVX uses the Cholesky factorization A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H to
*  compute the solution to a complex system of linear equations
*     A * X = B,
*  where A is an N-by-N Hermitian positive definite matrix stored in
*  packed format and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.
*
*  Error bounds on the solution and a condition estimate are also
*  provided.
*
*  Description
*  ===========
*
*  The following steps are performed:
*
*  1. If FACT = 'E', real scaling factors are computed to equilibrate
*     the system:
*        diag(S) * A * diag(S) * inv(diag(S)) * X = diag(S) * B
*     Whether or not the system will be equilibrated depends on the
*     scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, A is
*     overwritten by diag(S)*A*diag(S) and B by diag(S)*B.
*
*  2. If FACT = 'N' or 'E', the Cholesky decomposition is used to
*     factor the matrix A (after equilibration if FACT = 'E') as
*        A = U'* U ,  if UPLO = 'U', or
*        A = L * L',  if UPLO = 'L',
*     where U is an upper triangular matrix, L is a lower triangular
*     matrix, and ' indicates conjugate transpose.
*
*  3. If the leading i-by-i principal minor is not positive definite,
*     then the routine returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored
*     form of A is used to estimate the condition number of the matrix
*     A.  If the reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine
*     precision, INFO = N+1 is returned as a warning, but the routine
*     still goes on to solve for X and compute error bounds as
*     described below.
*
*  4. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
*     of A.
*
*  5. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution
*     matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates
*     for it.
*
*  6. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by
*     diag(S) so that it solves the original system before
*     equilibration.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  FACT    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies whether or not the factored form of the matrix A is

*                  If EQUED = 'Y', the matrix A has been equilibrated

*          diag(S)*A*diag(S).  The j-th column of A is stored in the
*          array AP as follows:

*          if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
*          See below for further details.  A is not modified if
*          FACT = 'F' or 'N', or if FACT = 'E' and EQUED = 'N' on exit.

*
*          If FACT = 'N', then AFP is an output argument and on exit
*          returns the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky
*          factorization A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H of the original
*          matrix A.
*
*          If FACT = 'E', then AFP is an output argument and on exit
*          returns the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky
*          factorization A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H of the equilibrated
*          matrix A (see the description of AP for the form of the
*          equilibrated matrix).

*  RCOND   (output) REAL
*          The estimate of the reciprocal condition number of the matrix
*          A after equilibration (if done).  If RCOND is less than the
*          machine precision (in particular, if RCOND = 0), the matrix
*          is singular to working precision.  This condition is
*          indicated by a return code of INFO > 0.
*
*  FERR    (output) REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
*          The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
*          X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
*          If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
*          is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
*          element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
*          largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
*          the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight
*          overestimate of the true error.
*
*  BERR    (output) REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
*          The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
*          vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
*          any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).

*
*  RWORK   (workspace) REAL array, dimension (N)

*          > 0:  if INFO = i, and i is
*                <= N:  the leading minor of order i of A is
*                       not positive definite, so the factorization
*                       could not be completed, and the solution has not
*                       been computed. RCOND = 0 is returned.
*                = N+1: U is nonsingular, but RCOND is less than machine
*                       precision, meaning that the matrix is singular
*                       to working precision.  Nevertheless, the
*                       solution and error bounds are computed because
*                       there are a number of situations where the
*                       computed solution can be more accurate than the
*                       value of RCOND would suggest.
