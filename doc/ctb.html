      SUBROUTINE CTBCON( NORM, UPLO, DIAG, N, KD, AB, LDAB, RCOND, WORK, RWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  CTBCON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number of a
*  triangular band matrix A, in either the 1-norm or the infinity-norm.
*
*  The norm of A is computed and an estimate is obtained for
*  norm(inv(A)), then the reciprocal of the condition number is
*  computed as
*     RCOND = 1 / ( norm(A) * norm(inv(A)) ).

*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U':  A is upper triangular;
*          = 'L':  A is lower triangular.
*
*  DIAG    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'N':  A is non-unit triangular;

*          The upper or lower triangular band matrix A, stored in the
*          first kd+1 rows of the array. The j-th column of A is stored
*          in the j-th column of the array AB as follows:
*          if UPLO = 'U', AB(kd+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-kd)<=i<=j;
*          if UPLO = 'L', AB(1+i-j,j)    = A(i,j) for j<=i<=min(n,j+kd).
*          If DIAG = 'U', the diagonal elements of A are not referenced
*          and are assumed to be 1.
*
*  LDAB    (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= KD+1.

*
*  WORK    (workspace) COMPLEX array, dimension (2*N)
*
*  RWORK   (workspace) REAL array, dimension (N)
*

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE CTBRFS( UPLO, TRANS, DIAG, N, KD, NRHS, AB, LDAB, B, LDB, X, LDX, FERR, BERR, WORK, RWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  CTBRFS provides error bounds and backward error estimates for the
*  solution to a system of linear equations with a triangular band
*  coefficient matrix.
*
*  The solution matrix X must be computed by CTBTRS or some other
*  means before entering this routine.  CTBRFS does not do iterative
*  refinement because doing so cannot improve the backward error.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U':  A is upper triangular;
*          = 'L':  A is lower triangular.
*
*  TRANS   (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies the form of the system of equations:
*          = 'N':  A * X = B     (No transpose)
*          = 'T':  A**T * X = B  (Transpose)
*          = 'C':  A**H * X = B  (Conjugate transpose)
*
*  DIAG    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'N':  A is non-unit triangular;
*          = 'U':  A is unit triangular.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  KD      (input) INTEGER
*          The number of superdiagonals or subdiagonals of the
*          triangular band matrix A.  KD >= 0.
*
*  NRHS    (input) INTEGER
*          The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
*          of the matrices B and X.  NRHS >= 0.
*
*  AB      (input) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDAB,N)
*          The upper or lower triangular band matrix A, stored in the
*          first kd+1 rows of the array. The j-th column of A is stored
*          in the j-th column of the array AB as follows:
*          if UPLO = 'U', AB(kd+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-kd)<=i<=j;
*          if UPLO = 'L', AB(1+i-j,j)    = A(i,j) for j<=i<=min(n,j+kd).
*          If DIAG = 'U', the diagonal elements of A are not referenced
*          and are assumed to be 1.
*
*  LDAB    (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= KD+1.
*
*  B       (input) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
*          The right hand side matrix B.
*
*  LDB     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
*
*  X       (input) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
*          The solution matrix X.
*
*  LDX     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
*
*  FERR    (output) REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
*          The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
*          X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
*          If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
*          is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
*          element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
*          largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
*          the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight
*          overestimate of the true error.
*
*  BERR    (output) REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
*          The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
*          vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
*          any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).
*
*  WORK    (workspace) COMPLEX array, dimension (2*N)
*
*  RWORK   (workspace) REAL array, dimension (N)
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
