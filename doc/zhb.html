      SUBROUTINE ZHBEVD( JOBZ, UPLO, N, KD, AB, LDAB, W, Z, LDZ, WORK, LWORK, RWORK, LRWORK, IWORK, LIWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  ZHBEVD computes all the eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors of
*  a complex Hermitian band matrix A.  If eigenvectors are desired, it
*  uses a divide and conquer algorithm.
*
*  The divide and conquer algorithm makes very mild assumptions about
*  floating point arithmetic. It will work on machines with a guard
*  digit in add/subtract, or on those binary machines without guard
*  digits which subtract like the Cray X-MP, Cray Y-MP, Cray C-90, or
*  Cray-2. It could conceivably fail on hexadecimal or decimal machines
*  without guard digits, but we know of none.

*          On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the Hermitian band
*          matrix A, stored in the first KD+1 rows of the array.  The

*          as follows:
*          if UPLO = 'U', AB(kd+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-kd)<=i<=j;
*          if UPLO = 'L', AB(1+i-j,j)    = A(i,j) for j<=i<=min(n,j+kd).
*
*          On exit, AB is overwritten by values generated during the

*          are returned in rows KD and KD+1 of AB, and if UPLO = 'L',

*
*          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
*          only calculates the optimal sizes of the WORK, RWORK and
*          IWORK arrays, returns these values as the first entries of
*          the WORK, RWORK and IWORK arrays, and no error message
*          related to LWORK or LRWORK or LIWORK is issued by XERBLA.

*          matrix B, stored in the first kb+1 rows of the array.  The
*          j-th column of B is stored in the j-th column of the array BB
*          as follows:
*          if UPLO = 'U', BB(kb+1+i-j,j) = B(i,j) for max(1,j-kb)<=i<=j;
*          if UPLO = 'L', BB(1+i-j,j)    = B(i,j) for j<=i<=min(n,j+kb).
*
*          On exit, the factor S from the split Cholesky factorization
*          B = S**H*S, as returned by ZPBSTF.
*
*  LDBB    (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array BB.  LDBB >= KB+1.
*
*  W       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          If INFO = 0, the eigenvalues in ascending order.
*
*  Z       (output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDZ, N)
*          If JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, Z contains the matrix Z of
*          eigenvectors, with the i-th column of Z holding the
*          eigenvector associated with W(i). The eigenvectors are
*          normalized so that Z**H*B*Z = I.
*          If JOBZ = 'N', then Z is not referenced.
*
*  LDZ     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDZ >= 1, and if
*          JOBZ = 'V', LDZ >= N.
*
*  WORK    (workspace/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
*          On exit, if INFO=0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
*
*  LWORK   (input) INTEGER
*          The dimension of the array WORK.

*          If JOBZ = 'N' and N > 1, LWORK >= N.
*          If JOBZ = 'V' and N > 1, LWORK >= 2*N**2.
*
*          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
*          only calculates the optimal sizes of the WORK, RWORK and
*          IWORK arrays, returns these values as the first entries of
*          the WORK, RWORK and IWORK arrays, and no error message
*          related to LWORK or LRWORK or LIWORK is issued by XERBLA.
*
*  RWORK   (workspace/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (MAX(1,LRWORK))
*          On exit, if INFO=0, RWORK(1) returns the optimal LRWORK.
*
*  LRWORK  (input) INTEGER
*          The dimension of array RWORK.
*          If N <= 1,               LRWORK >= 1.
*          If JOBZ = 'N' and N > 1, LRWORK >= N.
*          If JOBZ = 'V' and N > 1, LRWORK >= 1 + 5*N + 2*N**2.
*
*          If LRWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the
*          routine only calculates the optimal sizes of the WORK, RWORK
*          and IWORK arrays, returns these values as the first entries
*          of the WORK, RWORK and IWORK arrays, and no error message
*          related to LWORK or LRWORK or LIWORK is issued by XERBLA.
*
*  IWORK   (workspace/output) INTEGER array, dimension (MAX(1,LIWORK))
*          On exit, if INFO=0, IWORK(1) returns the optimal LIWORK.
*
*  LIWORK  (input) INTEGER
*          The dimension of array IWORK.
*          If JOBZ = 'N' or N <= 1, LIWORK >= 1.
*          If JOBZ = 'V' and N > 1, LIWORK >= 3 + 5*N.
*
*          If LIWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the
*          routine only calculates the optimal sizes of the WORK, RWORK
*          and IWORK arrays, returns these values as the first entries
*          of the WORK, RWORK and IWORK arrays, and no error message
*          related to LWORK or LRWORK or LIWORK is issued by XERBLA.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0:  if INFO = i, and i is:
*             <= N:  the algorithm failed to converge:
*                    i off-diagonal elements of an intermediate
*                    tridiagonal form did not converge to zero;
*             > N:   if INFO = N + i, for 1 <= i <= N, then ZPBSTF
*                    returned INFO = i: B is not positive definite.
*                    The factorization of B could not be completed and
*                    no eigenvalues or eigenvectors were computed.
