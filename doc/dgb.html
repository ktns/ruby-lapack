FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE DGBTF2( M, N, KL, KU, AB, LDAB, IPIV, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DGBTF2 computes an LU factorization of a real m-by-n band matrix A
*  using partial pivoting with row interchanges.
*
*  This is the unblocked version of the algorithm, calling Level 2 BLAS.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  M       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of rows of the matrix A.  M >= 0.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of columns of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  KL      (input) INTEGER
*          The number of subdiagonals within the band of A.  KL >= 0.
*
*  KU      (input) INTEGER
*          The number of superdiagonals within the band of A.  KU >= 0.
*
*  AB      (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDAB,N)
*          On entry, the matrix A in band storage, in rows KL+1 to
*          2*KL+KU+1; rows 1 to KL of the array need not be set.
*          The j-th column of A is stored in the j-th column of the
*          array AB as follows:
*          AB(kl+ku+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-ku)<=i<=min(m,j+kl)
*
*          On exit, details of the factorization: U is stored as an
*          upper triangular band matrix with KL+KU superdiagonals in
*          rows 1 to KL+KU+1, and the multipliers used during the
*          factorization are stored in rows KL+KU+2 to 2*KL+KU+1.
*          See below for further details.
*
*  LDAB    (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= 2*KL+KU+1.
*
*  IPIV    (output) INTEGER array, dimension (min(M,N))
*          The pivot indices; for 1 <= i <= min(M,N), row i of the
*          matrix was interchanged with row IPIV(i).
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0: successful exit
*          < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0: if INFO = +i, U(i,i) is exactly zero. The factorization
*               has been completed, but the factor U is exactly
*               singular, and division by zero will occur if it is used
*               to solve a system of equations.
*

*  Further Details
*  ===============
*
*  The band storage scheme is illustrated by the following example, when
*  M = N = 6, KL = 2, KU = 1:
*
*  On entry:                       On exit:
*
*      *    *    *    +    +    +       *    *    *   u14  u25  u36
*      *    *    +    +    +    +       *    *   u13  u24  u35  u46
*      *   a12  a23  a34  a45  a56      *   u12  u23  u34  u45  u56
*     a11  a22  a33  a44  a55  a66     u11  u22  u33  u44  u55  u66
*     a21  a32  a43  a54  a65   *      m21  m32  m43  m54  m65   *
*     a31  a42  a53  a64   *    *      m31  m42  m53  m64   *    *
*
*  Array elements marked * are not used by the routine; elements marked
*  + need not be set on entry, but are required by the routine to store
*  elements of U, because of fill-in resulting from the row
*  interchanges.

USAGE:
  x, rcond, ferr, berr, work, info, ab, afb, ipiv, equed, r, c, b = NumRu::Lapack.dgbsvx( fact, trans, kl, ku, ab, afb, ipiv, equed, r, c, b)

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE DGBSVX( FACT, TRANS, N, KL, KU, NRHS, AB, LDAB, AFB, LDAFB, IPIV, EQUED, R, C, B, LDB, X, LDX, RCOND, FERR, BERR, WORK, IWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DGBSVX uses the LU factorization to compute the solution to a real
*  system of linear equations A * X = B, A**T * X = B, or A**H * X = B,
*  where A is a band matrix of order N with KL subdiagonals and KU
*  superdiagonals, and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.
*
*  Error bounds on the solution and a condition estimate are also
*  provided.
*
*  Description
*  ===========
*
*  The following steps are performed by this subroutine:
*
*  1. If FACT = 'E', real scaling factors are computed to equilibrate
*     the system:
*        TRANS = 'N':  diag(R)*A*diag(C)     *inv(diag(C))*X = diag(R)*B
*        TRANS = 'T': (diag(R)*A*diag(C))**T *inv(diag(R))*X = diag(C)*B
*        TRANS = 'C': (diag(R)*A*diag(C))**H *inv(diag(R))*X = diag(C)*B
*     Whether or not the system will be equilibrated depends on the
*     scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, A is
*     overwritten by diag(R)*A*diag(C) and B by diag(R)*B (if TRANS='N')
*     or diag(C)*B (if TRANS = 'T' or 'C').
*
*  2. If FACT = 'N' or 'E', the LU decomposition is used to factor the
*     matrix A (after equilibration if FACT = 'E') as
*        A = L * U,
*     where L is a product of permutation and unit lower triangular
*     matrices with KL subdiagonals, and U is upper triangular with
*     KL+KU superdiagonals.
*
*  3. If some U(i,i)=0, so that U is exactly singular, then the routine
*     returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored form of A is used
*     to estimate the condition number of the matrix A.  If the
*     reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine precision,
*     INFO = N+1 is returned as a warning, but the routine still goes on
*     to solve for X and compute error bounds as described below.
*
*  4. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
*     of A.
*
*  5. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution
*     matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates
*     for it.
*
*  6. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by
*     diag(C) (if TRANS = 'N') or diag(R) (if TRANS = 'T' or 'C') so
*     that it solves the original system before equilibration.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  FACT    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies whether or not the factored form of the matrix A is
*          supplied on entry, and if not, whether the matrix A should be
*          equilibrated before it is factored.
*          = 'F':  On entry, AFB and IPIV contain the factored form of
*                  A.  If EQUED is not 'N', the matrix A has been
*                  equilibrated with scaling factors given by R and C.
*                  AB, AFB, and IPIV are not modified.
*          = 'N':  The matrix A will be copied to AFB and factored.
*          = 'E':  The matrix A will be equilibrated if necessary, then
*                  copied to AFB and factored.
*

*          AB(KU+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-KU)<=i<=min(N,j+kl)
*
*          If FACT = 'F' and EQUED is not 'N', then A must have been
*          equilibrated by the scaling factors in R and/or C.  AB is not
*          modified if FACT = 'F' or 'N', or if FACT = 'E' and

*
*          On exit, if EQUED .ne. 'N', A is scaled as follows:

*  BERR    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
*          The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
*          vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
*          any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).
*
*  WORK    (workspace/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (3*N)
*          On exit, WORK(1) contains the reciprocal pivot growth
*          factor norm(A)/norm(U). The "max absolute element" norm is

*          of the LU factorization of the (equilibrated) matrix A
*          could be poor. This also means that the solution X, condition
*          estimator RCOND, and forward error bound FERR could be
*          unreliable. If factorization fails with 0<INFO<=N, then
*          WORK(1) contains the reciprocal pivot growth factor for the

*                       precision, meaning that the matrix is singular

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DGBTRF computes an LU factorization of a real m-by-n band matrix A
*  using partial pivoting with row interchanges.
*
*  This is the blocked version of the algorithm, calling Level 3 BLAS.

*  M       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of rows of the matrix A.  M >= 0.

*
*  KL      (input) INTEGER
*          The number of subdiagonals within the band of A.  KL >= 0.
*
*  KU      (input) INTEGER
*          The number of superdiagonals within the band of A.  KU >= 0.
*
*  AB      (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDAB,N)
*          On entry, the matrix A in band storage, in rows KL+1 to
*          2*KL+KU+1; rows 1 to KL of the array need not be set.
*          The j-th column of A is stored in the j-th column of the
*          array AB as follows:
*          AB(kl+ku+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-ku)<=i<=min(m,j+kl)
*
*          On exit, details of the factorization: U is stored as an
*          upper triangular band matrix with KL+KU superdiagonals in
*          rows 1 to KL+KU+1, and the multipliers used during the
*          factorization are stored in rows KL+KU+2 to 2*KL+KU+1.

*          < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0: if INFO = +i, U(i,i) is exactly zero. The factorization
*               has been completed, but the factor U is exactly
*               singular, and division by zero will occur if it is used
*               to solve a system of equations.
*

*  Further Details

*
*  The band storage scheme is illustrated by the following example, when
*  M = N = 6, KL = 2, KU = 1:
*
*  On entry:                       On exit:

*  Array elements marked * are not used by the routine; elements marked

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DGBEQU computes row and column scalings intended to equilibrate an

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE DGBTRS( TRANS, N, KL, KU, NRHS, AB, LDAB, IPIV, B, LDB, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DGBTRS solves a system of linear equations
*     A * X = B  or  A' * X = B
*  with a general band matrix A using the LU factorization computed
*  by DGBTRF.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  TRANS   (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies the form of the system of equations.
*          = 'N':  A * X = B  (No transpose)
*          = 'T':  A'* X = B  (Transpose)
*          = 'C':  A'* X = B  (Conjugate transpose = Transpose)
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  KL      (input) INTEGER
*          The number of subdiagonals within the band of A.  KL >= 0.
*
*  KU      (input) INTEGER
*          The number of superdiagonals within the band of A.  KU >= 0.
*
*  NRHS    (input) INTEGER
*          The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
*          of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.
*
*  AB      (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDAB,N)
*          Details of the LU factorization of the band matrix A, as
*          computed by DGBTRF.  U is stored as an upper triangular band
*          matrix with KL+KU superdiagonals in rows 1 to KL+KU+1, and
*          the multipliers used during the factorization are stored in
*          rows KL+KU+2 to 2*KL+KU+1.
*
*  LDAB    (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= 2*KL+KU+1.
*
*  IPIV    (input) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*          The pivot indices; for 1 <= i <= N, row i of the matrix was
*          interchanged with row IPIV(i).
*
*  B       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
*          On entry, the right hand side matrix B.
*          On exit, the solution matrix X.
*
*  LDB     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
