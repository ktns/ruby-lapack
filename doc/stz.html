FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE STZRQF( M, N, A, LDA, TAU, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  This routine is deprecated and has been replaced by routine STZRZF.
*
*  STZRQF reduces the M-by-N ( M<=N ) real upper trapezoidal matrix A
*  to upper triangular form by means of orthogonal transformations.
*
*  The upper trapezoidal matrix A is factored as
*
*     A = ( R  0 ) * Z,
*
*  where Z is an N-by-N orthogonal matrix and R is an M-by-M upper
*  triangular matrix.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  M       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of rows of the matrix A.  M >= 0.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of columns of the matrix A.  N >= M.
*
*  A       (input/output) REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          On entry, the leading M-by-N upper trapezoidal part of the
*          array A must contain the matrix to be factorized.
*          On exit, the leading M-by-M upper triangular part of A
*          contains the upper triangular matrix R, and elements M+1 to
*          N of the first M rows of A, with the array TAU, represent the
*          orthogonal matrix Z as a product of M elementary reflectors.
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,M).
*
*  TAU     (output) REAL array, dimension (M)
*          The scalar factors of the elementary reflectors.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*

*  Further Details
*  ===============
*
*  The factorization is obtained by Householder's method.  The kth
*  transformation matrix, Z( k ), which is used to introduce zeros into
*  the ( m - k + 1 )th row of A, is given in the form
*
*     Z( k ) = ( I     0   ),
*              ( 0  T( k ) )
*
*  where
*
*     T( k ) = I - tau*u( k )*u( k )',   u( k ) = (   1    ),
*                                                 (   0    )
*                                                 ( z( k ) )
*
*  tau is a scalar and z( k ) is an ( n - m ) element vector.
*  tau and z( k ) are chosen to annihilate the elements of the kth row
*  of X.
*
*  The scalar tau is returned in the kth element of TAU and the vector
*  u( k ) in the kth row of A, such that the elements of z( k ) are
*  in  a( k, m + 1 ), ..., a( k, n ). The elements of R are returned in
*  the upper triangular part of A.
*
*  Z is given by
*
*     Z =  Z( 1 ) * Z( 2 ) * ... * Z( m ).

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE STZRZF( M, N, A, LDA, TAU, WORK, LWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  STZRZF reduces the M-by-N ( M<=N ) real upper trapezoidal matrix A
*  to upper triangular form by means of orthogonal transformations.
*
*  The upper trapezoidal matrix A is factored as
*
*     A = ( R  0 ) * Z,
*
*  where Z is an N-by-N orthogonal matrix and R is an M-by-M upper
*  triangular matrix.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  M       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of rows of the matrix A.  M >= 0.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of columns of the matrix A.  N >= M.
*
*  A       (input/output) REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          On entry, the leading M-by-N upper trapezoidal part of the
*          array A must contain the matrix to be factorized.
*          On exit, the leading M-by-M upper triangular part of A
*          contains the upper triangular matrix R, and elements M+1 to
*          N of the first M rows of A, with the array TAU, represent the
*          orthogonal matrix Z as a product of M elementary reflectors.
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,M).
*
*  TAU     (output) REAL array, dimension (M)
*          The scalar factors of the elementary reflectors.
*
*  WORK    (workspace/output) REAL array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
*
*  LWORK   (input) INTEGER
*          The dimension of the array WORK.  LWORK >= max(1,M).
*          For optimum performance LWORK >= M*NB, where NB is
*          the optimal blocksize.
*
*          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
*          only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
*          this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
*          message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*

*  Further Details
*  ===============
*
*  Based on contributions by
*    A. Petitet, Computer Science Dept., Univ. of Tenn., Knoxville, USA
*
*  The factorization is obtained by Householder's method.  The kth
*  transformation matrix, Z( k ), which is used to introduce zeros into
*  the ( m - k + 1 )th row of A, is given in the form
*
*     Z( k ) = ( I     0   ),
*              ( 0  T( k ) )
*
*  where
*
*     T( k ) = I - tau*u( k )*u( k )',   u( k ) = (   1    ),
*                                                 (   0    )
*                                                 ( z( k ) )
*
*  tau is a scalar and z( k ) is an ( n - m ) element vector.
*  tau and z( k ) are chosen to annihilate the elements of the kth row
*  of X.
*
*  The scalar tau is returned in the kth element of TAU and the vector
*  u( k ) in the kth row of A, such that the elements of z( k ) are
*  in  a( k, m + 1 ), ..., a( k, n ). The elements of R are returned in
*  the upper triangular part of A.
*
*  Z is given by
*
*     Z =  Z( 1 ) * Z( 2 ) * ... * Z( m ).
