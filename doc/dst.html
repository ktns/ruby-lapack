FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE DSTEBZ( RANGE, ORDER, N, VL, VU, IL, IU, ABSTOL, D, E, M, NSPLIT, W, IBLOCK, ISPLIT, WORK, IWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DSTEBZ computes the eigenvalues of a symmetric tridiagonal
*  matrix T.  The user may ask for all eigenvalues, all eigenvalues
*  in the half-open interval (VL, VU], or the IL-th through IU-th
*  eigenvalues.
*
*  To avoid overflow, the matrix must be scaled so that its
*  largest element is no greater than overflow**(1/2) *
*  underflow**(1/4) in absolute value, and for greatest
*  accuracy, it should not be much smaller than that.
*
*  See W. Kahan "Accurate Eigenvalues of a Symmetric Tridiagonal
*  Matrix", Report CS41, Computer Science Dept., Stanford
*  University, July 21, 1966.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  RANGE   (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'A': ("All")   all eigenvalues will be found.
*          = 'V': ("Value") all eigenvalues in the half-open interval
*                           (VL, VU] will be found.
*          = 'I': ("Index") the IL-th through IU-th eigenvalues (of the
*                           entire matrix) will be found.
*
*  ORDER   (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'B': ("By Block") the eigenvalues will be grouped by
*                              split-off block (see IBLOCK, ISPLIT) and
*                              ordered from smallest to largest within
*                              the block.
*          = 'E': ("Entire matrix")
*                              the eigenvalues for the entire matrix
*                              will be ordered from smallest to
*                              largest.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the tridiagonal matrix T.  N >= 0.
*
*  VL      (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
*  VU      (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          If RANGE='V', the lower and upper bounds of the interval to
*          be searched for eigenvalues.  Eigenvalues less than or equal
*          to VL, or greater than VU, will not be returned.  VL < VU.
*          Not referenced if RANGE = 'A' or 'I'.
*
*  IL      (input) INTEGER
*  IU      (input) INTEGER
*          If RANGE='I', the indices (in ascending order) of the
*          smallest and largest eigenvalues to be returned.
*          1 <= IL <= IU <= N, if N > 0; IL = 1 and IU = 0 if N = 0.
*          Not referenced if RANGE = 'A' or 'V'.
*
*  ABSTOL  (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The absolute tolerance for the eigenvalues.  An eigenvalue
*          (or cluster) is considered to be located if it has been
*          determined to lie in an interval whose width is ABSTOL or
*          less.  If ABSTOL is less than or equal to zero, then ULP*|T|
*          will be used, where |T| means the 1-norm of T.
*
*          Eigenvalues will be computed most accurately when ABSTOL is
*          set to twice the underflow threshold 2*DLAMCH('S'), not zero.
*
*  D       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          The n diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix T.
*
*  E       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1)
*          The (n-1) off-diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix T.
*
*  M       (output) INTEGER
*          The actual number of eigenvalues found. 0 <= M <= N.
*          (See also the description of INFO=2,3.)
*
*  NSPLIT  (output) INTEGER
*          The number of diagonal blocks in the matrix T.
*          1 <= NSPLIT <= N.
*
*  W       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          On exit, the first M elements of W will contain the
*          eigenvalues.  (DSTEBZ may use the remaining N-M elements as
*          workspace.)
*
*  IBLOCK  (output) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*          At each row/column j where E(j) is zero or small, the
*          matrix T is considered to split into a block diagonal
*          matrix.  On exit, if INFO = 0, IBLOCK(i) specifies to which
*          block (from 1 to the number of blocks) the eigenvalue W(i)
*          belongs.  (DSTEBZ may use the remaining N-M elements as
*          workspace.)
*
*  ISPLIT  (output) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*          The splitting points, at which T breaks up into submatrices.
*          The first submatrix consists of rows/columns 1 to ISPLIT(1),
*          the second of rows/columns ISPLIT(1)+1 through ISPLIT(2),
*          etc., and the NSPLIT-th consists of rows/columns
*          ISPLIT(NSPLIT-1)+1 through ISPLIT(NSPLIT)=N.
*          (Only the first NSPLIT elements will actually be used, but
*          since the user cannot know a priori what value NSPLIT will
*          have, N words must be reserved for ISPLIT.)
*
*  WORK    (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (4*N)
*
*  IWORK   (workspace) INTEGER array, dimension (3*N)
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0:  some or all of the eigenvalues failed to converge or
*                were not computed:
*                =1 or 3: Bisection failed to converge for some
*                        eigenvalues; these eigenvalues are flagged by a
*                        negative block number.  The effect is that the
*                        eigenvalues may not be as accurate as the
*                        absolute and relative tolerances.  This is
*                        generally caused by unexpectedly inaccurate
*                        arithmetic.
*                =2 or 3: RANGE='I' only: Not all of the eigenvalues
*                        IL:IU were found.
*                        Effect: M < IU+1-IL
*                        Cause:  non-monotonic arithmetic, causing the
*                                Sturm sequence to be non-monotonic.
*                        Cure:   recalculate, using RANGE='A', and pick
*                                out eigenvalues IL:IU.  In some cases,
*                                increasing the PARAMETER "FUDGE" may
*                                make things work.
*                = 4:    RANGE='I', and the Gershgorin interval
*                        initially used was too small.  No eigenvalues
*                        were computed.
*                        Probable cause: your machine has sloppy
*                                        floating-point arithmetic.
*                        Cure: Increase the PARAMETER "FUDGE",
*                              recompile, and try again.
*
*  Internal Parameters
*  ===================
*
*  RELFAC  DOUBLE PRECISION, default = 2.0e0
*          The relative tolerance.  An interval (a,b] lies within
*          "relative tolerance" if  b-a < RELFAC*ulp*max(|a|,|b|),
*          where "ulp" is the machine precision (distance from 1 to
*          the next larger floating point number.)
*
*  FUDGE   DOUBLE PRECISION, default = 2
*          A "fudge factor" to widen the Gershgorin intervals.  Ideally,
*          a value of 1 should work, but on machines with sloppy
*          arithmetic, this needs to be larger.  The default for
*          publicly released versions should be large enough to handle
*          the worst machine around.  Note that this has no effect
*          on accuracy of the solution.

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE DSTEDC( COMPZ, N, D, E, Z, LDZ, WORK, LWORK, IWORK, LIWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DSTEDC computes all eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors of a
*  symmetric tridiagonal matrix using the divide and conquer method.
*  The eigenvectors of a full or band real symmetric matrix can also be
*  found if DSYTRD or DSPTRD or DSBTRD has been used to reduce this
*  matrix to tridiagonal form.
*
*  This code makes very mild assumptions about floating point
*  arithmetic. It will work on machines with a guard digit in
*  add/subtract, or on those binary machines without guard digits
*  which subtract like the Cray X-MP, Cray Y-MP, Cray C-90, or Cray-2.
*  It could conceivably fail on hexadecimal or decimal machines
*  without guard digits, but we know of none.  See DLAED3 for details.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  COMPZ   (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'N':  Compute eigenvalues only.
*          = 'I':  Compute eigenvectors of tridiagonal matrix also.
*          = 'V':  Compute eigenvectors of original dense symmetric
*                  matrix also.  On entry, Z contains the orthogonal
*                  matrix used to reduce the original matrix to
*                  tridiagonal form.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The dimension of the symmetric tridiagonal matrix.  N >= 0.
*
*  D       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          On entry, the diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix.
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, the eigenvalues in ascending order.
*
*  E       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1)
*          On entry, the subdiagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix.
*          On exit, E has been destroyed.
*
*  Z       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDZ,N)
*          On entry, if COMPZ = 'V', then Z contains the orthogonal
*          matrix used in the reduction to tridiagonal form.
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, then if COMPZ = 'V', Z contains the
*          orthonormal eigenvectors of the original symmetric matrix,
*          and if COMPZ = 'I', Z contains the orthonormal eigenvectors
*          of the symmetric tridiagonal matrix.
*          If  COMPZ = 'N', then Z is not referenced.
*
*  LDZ     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDZ >= 1.
*          If eigenvectors are desired, then LDZ >= max(1,N).
*
*  WORK    (workspace/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array,
*                                         dimension (LWORK)
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
*
*  LWORK   (input) INTEGER
*          The dimension of the array WORK.
*          If COMPZ = 'N' or N <= 1 then LWORK must be at least 1.
*          If COMPZ = 'V' and N > 1 then LWORK must be at least
*                         ( 1 + 3*N + 2*N*lg N + 3*N**2 ),
*                         where lg( N ) = smallest integer k such
*                         that 2**k >= N.
*          If COMPZ = 'I' and N > 1 then LWORK must be at least
*                         ( 1 + 4*N + N**2 ).
*          Note that for COMPZ = 'I' or 'V', then if N is less than or
*          equal to the minimum divide size, usually 25, then LWORK need
*          only be max(1,2*(N-1)).
*
*          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
*          only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
*          this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
*          message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
*
*  IWORK   (workspace/output) INTEGER array, dimension (MAX(1,LIWORK))
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, IWORK(1) returns the optimal LIWORK.
*
*  LIWORK  (input) INTEGER
*          The dimension of the array IWORK.
*          If COMPZ = 'N' or N <= 1 then LIWORK must be at least 1.
*          If COMPZ = 'V' and N > 1 then LIWORK must be at least
*                         ( 6 + 6*N + 5*N*lg N ).
*          If COMPZ = 'I' and N > 1 then LIWORK must be at least
*                         ( 3 + 5*N ).
*          Note that for COMPZ = 'I' or 'V', then if N is less than or
*          equal to the minimum divide size, usually 25, then LIWORK
*          need only be 1.
*
*          If LIWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the
*          routine only calculates the optimal size of the IWORK array,
*          returns this value as the first entry of the IWORK array, and
*          no error message related to LIWORK is issued by XERBLA.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit.
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
*          > 0:  The algorithm failed to compute an eigenvalue while
*                working on the submatrix lying in rows and columns
*                INFO/(N+1) through mod(INFO,N+1).

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE DSTEGR( JOBZ, RANGE, N, D, E, VL, VU, IL, IU, ABSTOL, M, W, Z, LDZ, ISUPPZ, WORK, LWORK, IWORK, LIWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DSTEGR computes selected eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors
*  of a real symmetric tridiagonal matrix T. Any such unreduced matrix has
*  a well defined set of pairwise different real eigenvalues, the corresponding
*  real eigenvectors are pairwise orthogonal.
*
*  The spectrum may be computed either completely or partially by specifying
*  either an interval (VL,VU] or a range of indices IL:IU for the desired
*  eigenvalues.
*
*  DSTEGR is a compatability wrapper around the improved DSTEMR routine.
*  See DSTEMR for further details.
*
*  One important change is that the ABSTOL parameter no longer provides any
*  benefit and hence is no longer used.
*
*  Note : DSTEGR and DSTEMR work only on machines which follow
*  IEEE-754 floating-point standard in their handling of infinities and
*  NaNs.  Normal execution may create these exceptiona values and hence
*  may abort due to a floating point exception in environments which
*  do not conform to the IEEE-754 standard.

*          On entry, the (N-1) subdiagonal elements of the tridiagonal
*          matrix T in elements 1 to N-1 of E. E(N) need not be set on
*          input, but is used internally as workspace.
*          On exit, E is overwritten.
*
*  VL      (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
*  VU      (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          If RANGE='V', the lower and upper bounds of the interval to

*          Not referenced if RANGE = 'A' or 'I'.
*
*  IL      (input) INTEGER
*  IU      (input) INTEGER
*          If RANGE='I', the indices (in ascending order) of the
*          smallest and largest eigenvalues to be returned.
*          1 <= IL <= IU <= N, if N > 0.
*          Not referenced if RANGE = 'A' or 'V'.
*
*  ABSTOL  (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          Unused.  Was the absolute error tolerance for the
*          eigenvalues/eigenvectors in previous versions.
*
*  M       (output) INTEGER
*          The total number of eigenvalues found.  0 <= M <= N.
*          If RANGE = 'A', M = N, and if RANGE = 'I', M = IU-IL+1.
*
*  W       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          The first M elements contain the selected eigenvalues in
*          ascending order.
*
*  Z       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDZ, max(1,M) )
*          If JOBZ = 'V', and if INFO = 0, then the first M columns of Z
*          contain the orthonormal eigenvectors of the matrix T

*          column of Z holding the eigenvector associated with W(i).
*          If JOBZ = 'N', then Z is not referenced.
*          Note: the user must ensure that at least max(1,M) columns are
*          supplied in the array Z; if RANGE = 'V', the exact value of M
*          is not known in advance and an upper bound must be used.
*          Supplying N columns is always safe.
*
*  LDZ     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDZ >= 1, and if
*          JOBZ = 'V', then LDZ >= max(1,N).
*
*  ISUPPZ  (output) INTEGER ARRAY, dimension ( 2*max(1,M) )
*          The support of the eigenvectors in Z, i.e., the indices
*          indicating the nonzero elements in Z. The i-th computed eigenvector
*          is nonzero only in elements ISUPPZ( 2*i-1 ) through
*          ISUPPZ( 2*i ). This is relevant in the case when the matrix
*          is split. ISUPPZ is only accessed when JOBZ is 'V' and N > 0.
*

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE DSTEMR( JOBZ, RANGE, N, D, E, VL, VU, IL, IU, M, W, Z, LDZ, NZC, ISUPPZ, TRYRAC, WORK, LWORK, IWORK, LIWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DSTEMR computes selected eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors
*  of a real symmetric tridiagonal matrix T. Any such unreduced matrix has
*  a well defined set of pairwise different real eigenvalues, the corresponding
*  real eigenvectors are pairwise orthogonal.
*
*  The spectrum may be computed either completely or partially by specifying
*  either an interval (VL,VU] or a range of indices IL:IU for the desired
*  eigenvalues.
*
*  Depending on the number of desired eigenvalues, these are computed either
*  by bisection or the dqds algorithm. Numerically orthogonal eigenvectors are
*  computed by the use of various suitable L D L^T factorizations near clusters
*  of close eigenvalues (referred to as RRRs, Relatively Robust
*  Representations). An informal sketch of the algorithm follows.
*
*  For each unreduced block (submatrix) of T,
*     (a) Compute T - sigma I  = L D L^T, so that L and D
*         define all the wanted eigenvalues to high relative accuracy.
*         This means that small relative changes in the entries of D and L
*         cause only small relative changes in the eigenvalues and
*         eigenvectors. The standard (unfactored) representation of the
*         tridiagonal matrix T does not have this property in general.
*     (b) Compute the eigenvalues to suitable accuracy.
*         If the eigenvectors are desired, the algorithm attains full
*         accuracy of the computed eigenvalues only right before
*         the corresponding vectors have to be computed, see steps c) and d).
*     (c) For each cluster of close eigenvalues, select a new
*         shift close to the cluster, find a new factorization, and refine
*         the shifted eigenvalues to suitable accuracy.
*     (d) For each eigenvalue with a large enough relative separation compute
*         the corresponding eigenvector by forming a rank revealing twisted
*         factorization. Go back to (c) for any clusters that remain.

      SUBROUTINE DSTEVD( JOBZ, N, D, E, Z, LDZ, WORK, LWORK, IWORK, LIWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DSTEVD computes all eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors of a
*  real symmetric tridiagonal matrix. If eigenvectors are desired, it
*  uses a divide and conquer algorithm.
*
*  The divide and conquer algorithm makes very mild assumptions about
*  floating point arithmetic. It will work on machines with a guard
*  digit in add/subtract, or on those binary machines without guard
*  digits which subtract like the Cray X-MP, Cray Y-MP, Cray C-90, or
*  Cray-2. It could conceivably fail on hexadecimal or decimal machines
*  without guard digits, but we know of none.

      SUBROUTINE DSTEVR( JOBZ, RANGE, N, D, E, VL, VU, IL, IU, ABSTOL, M, W, Z, LDZ, ISUPPZ, WORK, LWORK, IWORK, LIWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DSTEVR computes selected eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors
*  of a real symmetric tridiagonal matrix T.  Eigenvalues and
*  eigenvectors can be selected by specifying either a range of values
*  or a range of indices for the desired eigenvalues.
*
*  Whenever possible, DSTEVR calls DSTEMR to compute the
*  eigenspectrum using Relatively Robust Representations.  DSTEMR
*  computes eigenvalues by the dqds algorithm, while orthogonal
*  eigenvectors are computed from various "good" L D L^T representations
*  (also known as Relatively Robust Representations). Gram-Schmidt
*  orthogonalization is avoided as far as possible. More specifically,
*  the various steps of the algorithm are as follows. For the i-th
*  unreduced block of T,
*     (a) Compute T - sigma_i = L_i D_i L_i^T, such that L_i D_i L_i^T
*          is a relatively robust representation,
*     (b) Compute the eigenvalues, lambda_j, of L_i D_i L_i^T to high
*         relative accuracy by the dqds algorithm,
*     (c) If there is a cluster of close eigenvalues, "choose" sigma_i
*         close to the cluster, and go to step (a),
*     (d) Given the approximate eigenvalue lambda_j of L_i D_i L_i^T,
*         compute the corresponding eigenvector by forming a
*         rank-revealing twisted factorization.
*  The desired accuracy of the output can be specified by the input
*  parameter ABSTOL.
*
*  For more details, see "A new O(n^2) algorithm for the symmetric
*  tridiagonal eigenvalue/eigenvector problem", by Inderjit Dhillon,
*  Computer Science Division Technical Report No. UCB//CSD-97-971,
*  UC Berkeley, May 1997.
*
*
*  Note 1 : DSTEVR calls DSTEMR when the full spectrum is requested
*  on machines which conform to the ieee-754 floating point standard.
*  DSTEVR calls DSTEBZ and DSTEIN on non-ieee machines and
*  when partial spectrum requests are made.
*
*  Normal execution of DSTEMR may create NaNs and infinities and
*  hence may abort due to a floating point exception in environments
*  which do not handle NaNs and infinities in the ieee standard default
*  manner.

*
*          If high relative accuracy is important, set ABSTOL to
