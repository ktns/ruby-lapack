      SUBROUTINE ZTPCON( NORM, UPLO, DIAG, N, AP, RCOND, WORK, RWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  ZTPCON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number of a packed
*  triangular matrix A, in either the 1-norm or the infinity-norm.
*
*  The norm of A is computed and an estimate is obtained for
*  norm(inv(A)), then the reciprocal of the condition number is
*  computed as
*     RCOND = 1 / ( norm(A) * norm(inv(A)) ).
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  NORM    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies whether the 1-norm condition number or the
*          infinity-norm condition number is required:
*          = '1' or 'O':  1-norm;
*          = 'I':         Infinity-norm.
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U':  A is upper triangular;
*          = 'L':  A is lower triangular.
*
*  DIAG    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'N':  A is non-unit triangular;
*          = 'U':  A is unit triangular.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  AP      (input) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
*          The upper or lower triangular matrix A, packed columnwise in
*          a linear array.  The j-th column of A is stored in the array
*          AP as follows:
*          if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
*          if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
*          If DIAG = 'U', the diagonal elements of A are not referenced
*          and are assumed to be 1.
*
*  RCOND   (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A,
*          computed as RCOND = 1/(norm(A) * norm(inv(A))).
*
*  WORK    (workspace) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (2*N)
*
*  RWORK   (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE ZTPRFS( UPLO, TRANS, DIAG, N, NRHS, AP, B, LDB, X, LDX, FERR, BERR, WORK, RWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  ZTPRFS provides error bounds and backward error estimates for the
*  solution to a system of linear equations with a triangular packed
*  coefficient matrix.
*
*  The solution matrix X must be computed by ZTPTRS or some other
*  means before entering this routine.  ZTPRFS does not do iterative
*  refinement because doing so cannot improve the backward error.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U':  A is upper triangular;
*          = 'L':  A is lower triangular.
*
*  TRANS   (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies the form of the system of equations:
*          = 'N':  A * X = B     (No transpose)
*          = 'T':  A**T * X = B  (Transpose)
*          = 'C':  A**H * X = B  (Conjugate transpose)
*
*  DIAG    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'N':  A is non-unit triangular;
*          = 'U':  A is unit triangular.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  NRHS    (input) INTEGER
*          The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
*          of the matrices B and X.  NRHS >= 0.
*
*  AP      (input) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
*          The upper or lower triangular matrix A, packed columnwise in
*          a linear array.  The j-th column of A is stored in the array
*          AP as follows:
*          if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
*          if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
*          If DIAG = 'U', the diagonal elements of A are not referenced
*          and are assumed to be 1.
*
*  B       (input) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
*          The right hand side matrix B.
*
*  LDB     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
*
*  X       (input) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
*          The solution matrix X.
*
*  LDX     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
*
*  FERR    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
*          The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
*          X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
*          If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
*          is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
*          element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
*          largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
*          the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight
*          overestimate of the true error.
*
*  BERR    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
*          The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
*          vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
*          any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).
*
*  WORK    (workspace) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (2*N)
*
*  RWORK   (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE ZTPTRI( UPLO, DIAG, N, AP, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  ZTPTRI computes the inverse of a complex upper or lower triangular
*  matrix A stored in packed format.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U':  A is upper triangular;
*          = 'L':  A is lower triangular.
*

*          = 'N':  A is non-unit triangular;
*          = 'U':  A is unit triangular.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  AP      (input/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
*          On entry, the upper or lower triangular matrix A, stored
*          columnwise in a linear array.  The j-th column of A is stored
*          in the array AP as follows:
*          if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
*          if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*((2*n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
*          See below for further details.
*          On exit, the (triangular) inverse of the original matrix, in
*          the same packed storage format.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0:  if INFO = i, A(i,i) is exactly zero.  The triangular
*                matrix is singular and its inverse can not be computed.
*

*  Further Details
*  ===============
*
*  A triangular matrix A can be transferred to packed storage using one
*  of the following program segments:
*
*  UPLO = 'U':                      UPLO = 'L':
*
*        JC = 1                           JC = 1
*        DO 2 J = 1, N                    DO 2 J = 1, N
*           DO 1 I = 1, J                    DO 1 I = J, N
*              AP(JC+I-1) = A(I,J)              AP(JC+I-J) = A(I,J)
*      1    CONTINUE                    1    CONTINUE
*           JC = JC + J                      JC = JC + N - J + 1
*      2 CONTINUE                       2 CONTINUE
