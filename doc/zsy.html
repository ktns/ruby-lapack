*     Purpose
*     =======
*
*     ZSYRFSX improves the computed solution to a system of linear
*     equations when the coefficient matrix is symmetric indefinite, and
*     provides error bounds and backward error estimates for the
*     solution.  In addition to normwise error bound, the code provides
*     maximum componentwise error bound if possible.  See comments for
*     ERR_BNDS_NORM and ERR_BNDS_COMP for details of the error bounds.
*
*     The original system of linear equations may have been equilibrated
*     before calling this routine, as described by arguments EQUED and S
*     below. In this case, the solution and error bounds returned are
*     for the original unequilibrated system.
*

*     Arguments
*     =========
*
*     Some optional parameters are bundled in the PARAMS array.  These
*     settings determine how refinement is performed, but often the
*     defaults are acceptable.  If the defaults are acceptable, users
*     can pass NPARAMS = 0 which prevents the source code from accessing
*     the PARAMS argument.
*
*     UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*       = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
*       = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
*
*     EQUED   (input) CHARACTER*1
*     Specifies the form of equilibration that was done to A
*     before calling this routine. This is needed to compute
*     the solution and error bounds correctly.
*       = 'N':  No equilibration
*       = 'Y':  Both row and column equilibration, i.e., A has been
*               replaced by diag(S) * A * diag(S).
*               The right hand side B has been changed accordingly.
*
*     N       (input) INTEGER
*     The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*     NRHS    (input) INTEGER
*     The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
*     of the matrices B and X.  NRHS >= 0.
*

*     part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower triangular
*     part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the leading
*     N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
*     triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
*     triangular part of A is not referenced.
*
*     LDA     (input) INTEGER
*     The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
*
*     AF      (input) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDAF,N)
*     The factored form of the matrix A.  AF contains the block

*
*     LDAF    (input) INTEGER
*     The leading dimension of the array AF.  LDAF >= max(1,N).
*
*     IPIV    (input) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*     Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D
*     as determined by DSYTRF.
*
*     S       (input or output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*     The scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'Y', A is multiplied on
*     the left and right by diag(S).  S is an input argument if FACT =
*     'F'; otherwise, S is an output argument.  If FACT = 'F' and EQUED
*     = 'Y', each element of S must be positive.  If S is output, each
*     element of S is a power of the radix. If S is input, each element
*     of S should be a power of the radix to ensure a reliable solution
*     and error estimates. Scaling by powers of the radix does not cause
*     rounding errors unless the result underflows or overflows.
*     Rounding errors during scaling lead to refining with a matrix that
*     is not equivalent to the input matrix, producing error estimates
*     that may not be reliable.
*
*     B       (input) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
*     The right hand side matrix B.

*
*     X       (input/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
*     On entry, the solution matrix X, as computed by DGETRS.
*     On exit, the improved solution matrix X.
*
*     LDX     (input) INTEGER
*     The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
*
*     RCOND   (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*     Reciprocal scaled condition number.  This is an estimate of the
*     reciprocal Skeel condition number of the matrix A after
*     equilibration (if done).  If this is less than the machine
*     precision (in particular, if it is zero), the matrix is singular
*     to working precision.  Note that the error may still be small even
*     if this number is very small and the matrix appears ill-
*     conditioned.
*
*     BERR    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
*     Componentwise relative backward error.  This is the
*     componentwise relative backward error of each solution vector X(j)
*     (i.e., the smallest relative change in any element of A or B that
*     makes X(j) an exact solution).
*
*     N_ERR_BNDS (input) INTEGER
*     Number of error bounds to return for each right hand side
*     and each type (normwise or componentwise).  See ERR_BNDS_NORM and
*     ERR_BNDS_COMP below.
*
*     ERR_BNDS_NORM  (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
*     For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
*     various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
*     normwise relative error, which is defined as follows:
*
*     Normwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
*             max_j (abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i)))
*            ------------------------------
*                  max_j abs(X(j,i))
*
*     The array is indexed by the type of error information as described
*     below. There currently are up to three pieces of information
*     returned.
*
*     The first index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(i,:) corresponds to the ith
*     right-hand side.
*
*     The second index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,err) contains the following
*     three fields:
*     err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
*              reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
*              sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon').
*
*     err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
*              almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
*              so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
*              sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
*              be trusted if the previous boolean is true.
*
*     err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated normwise
*              reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
*              sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
*              estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
*              numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
*              appropriately scaled matrix Z.
*              Let Z = S*A, where S scales each row by a power of the
*              radix so all absolute row sums of Z are approximately 1.
*
*     See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
*     cautions.
*
*     ERR_BNDS_COMP  (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
*     For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
*     various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
*     componentwise relative error, which is defined as follows:
*
*     Componentwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
*                    abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i))
*             max_j ----------------------
*                         abs(X(j,i))
*
*     The array is indexed by the right-hand side i (on which the
*     componentwise relative error depends), and the type of error
*     information as described below. There currently are up to three
*     pieces of information returned for each right-hand side. If
*     componentwise accuracy is not requested (PARAMS(3) = 0.0), then
*     ERR_BNDS_COMP is not accessed.  If N_ERR_BNDS .LT. 3, then at most
*     the first (:,N_ERR_BNDS) entries are returned.
*
*     The first index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(i,:) corresponds to the ith
*     right-hand side.
*
*     The second index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,err) contains the following
*     three fields:
*     err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
*              reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
*              sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon').

*     err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
*              almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
*              so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
*              sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
*              be trusted if the previous boolean is true.
*
*     err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated componentwise

*              numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
*              appropriately scaled matrix Z.
*              Let Z = S*(A*diag(x)), where x is the solution for the
*              current right-hand side and S scales each row of
*              A*diag(x) by a power of the radix so all absolute row
*              sums of Z are approximately 1.

*
*     PARAMS  (input / output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension NPARAMS

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE ZSYSV( UPLO, N, NRHS, A, LDA, IPIV, B, LDB, WORK, LWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  ZSYSV computes the solution to a complex system of linear equations
*     A * X = B,
*  where A is an N-by-N symmetric matrix and X and B are N-by-NRHS
*  matrices.
*
*  The diagonal pivoting method is used to factor A as
*     A = U * D * U**T,  if UPLO = 'U', or
*     A = L * D * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
*  where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
*  triangular matrices, and D is symmetric and block diagonal with
*  1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.  The factored form of A is then
*  used to solve the system of equations A * X = B.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
*          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
*          matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  NRHS    (input) INTEGER
*          The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
*          of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.
*
*  A       (input/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          On entry, the symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
*          N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the upper
*          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
*          triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
*          leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
*          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
*          triangular part of A is not referenced.
*
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, the block diagonal matrix D and the
*          multipliers used to obtain the factor U or L from the
*          factorization A = U*D*U**T or A = L*D*L**T as computed by
*          ZSYTRF.
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
*
*  IPIV    (output) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*          Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D, as
*          determined by ZSYTRF.  If IPIV(k) > 0, then rows and columns
*          k and IPIV(k) were interchanged, and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1
*          diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'U' and IPIV(k) = IPIV(k-1) < 0,
*          then rows and columns k-1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged and
*          D(k-1:k,k-1:k) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'L' and
*          IPIV(k) = IPIV(k+1) < 0, then rows and columns k+1 and
*          -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k:k+1,k:k+1) is a 2-by-2
*          diagonal block.
*
*  B       (input/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
*          On entry, the N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X.
*
*  LDB     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
*
*  WORK    (workspace/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
*
*  LWORK   (input) INTEGER
*          The length of WORK.  LWORK >= 1, and for best performance
*          LWORK >= max(1,N*NB), where NB is the optimal blocksize for
*          ZSYTRF.
*
*          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
*          only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
*          this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
*          message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0: successful exit
*          < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0: if INFO = i, D(i,i) is exactly zero.  The factorization
*               has been completed, but the block diagonal matrix D is
*               exactly singular, so the solution could not be computed.

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE ZSYSVX( FACT, UPLO, N, NRHS, A, LDA, AF, LDAF, IPIV, B, LDB, X, LDX, RCOND, FERR, BERR, WORK, LWORK, RWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  ZSYSVX uses the diagonal pivoting factorization to compute the
*  solution to a complex system of linear equations A * X = B,
*  where A is an N-by-N symmetric matrix and X and B are N-by-NRHS
*  matrices.
*
*  Error bounds on the solution and a condition estimate are also
*  provided.
*
*  Description
*  ===========
*
*  The following steps are performed:
*
*  1. If FACT = 'N', the diagonal pivoting method is used to factor A.
*     The form of the factorization is
*        A = U * D * U**T,  if UPLO = 'U', or
*        A = L * D * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
*     where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
*     triangular matrices, and D is symmetric and block diagonal with
*     1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.
*
*  2. If some D(i,i)=0, so that D is exactly singular, then the routine
*     returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored form of A is used
*     to estimate the condition number of the matrix A.  If the
*     reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine precision,
*     INFO = N+1 is returned as a warning, but the routine still goes on
*     to solve for X and compute error bounds as described below.
*
*  3. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
*     of A.
*
*  4. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution
*     matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates
*     for it.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  FACT    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies whether or not the factored form of A has been
*          supplied on entry.
*          = 'F':  On entry, AF and IPIV contain the factored form
*                  of A.  A, AF and IPIV will not be modified.
*          = 'N':  The matrix A will be copied to AF and factored.
*

*
*  A       (input) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          The symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading N-by-N
*          upper triangular part of A contains the upper triangular part
*          of the matrix A, and the strictly lower triangular part of A
*          is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the leading N-by-N lower
*          triangular part of A contains the lower triangular part of
*          the matrix A, and the strictly upper triangular part of A is

*          contains the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used
*          to obtain the factor U or L from the factorization
*          A = U*D*U**T or A = L*D*L**T as computed by ZSYTRF.
*
*          If FACT = 'N', then AF is an output argument and on exit
*          returns the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used
*          to obtain the factor U or L from the factorization
*          A = U*D*U**T or A = L*D*L**T.
*
*  LDAF    (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array AF.  LDAF >= max(1,N).
*
*  IPIV    (input or output) INTEGER array, dimension (N)

*          contains details of the interchanges and the block structure
*          of D, as determined by ZSYTRF.
*          If IPIV(k) > 0, then rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were
*          interchanged and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.
*          If UPLO = 'U' and IPIV(k) = IPIV(k-1) < 0, then rows and
*          columns k-1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k-1:k,k-1:k)
*          is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'L' and IPIV(k) =
*          IPIV(k+1) < 0, then rows and columns k+1 and -IPIV(k) were
*          interchanged and D(k:k+1,k:k+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.
*
*          If FACT = 'N', then IPIV is an output argument and on exit
*          contains details of the interchanges and the block structure
*          of D, as determined by ZSYTRF.
*
*  B       (input) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
*          The N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.
*
*  LDB     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).

*          The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
*
*  RCOND   (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The estimate of the reciprocal condition number of the matrix
*          A.  If RCOND is less than the machine precision (in
*          particular, if RCOND = 0), the matrix is singular to working
*          precision.  This condition is indicated by a return code of
*          INFO > 0.
*
*  FERR    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
*          The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
*          X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
*          If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
*          is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
*          element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
*          largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
*          the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight
*          overestimate of the true error.
*
*  BERR    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
*          The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
*          vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
*          any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).
*
*  WORK    (workspace/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
*
*  LWORK   (input) INTEGER
*          The length of WORK.  LWORK >= max(1,2*N), and for best
*          performance, when FACT = 'N', LWORK >= max(1,2*N,N*NB), where
*          NB is the optimal blocksize for ZSYTRF.
*
*          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
*          only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
*          this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
*          message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
*
*  RWORK   (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0: successful exit
*          < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0: if INFO = i, and i is
*                <= N:  D(i,i) is exactly zero.  The factorization
*                       has been completed but the factor D is exactly
*                       singular, so the solution and error bounds could
*                       not be computed. RCOND = 0 is returned.
*                = N+1: D is nonsingular, but RCOND is less than machine
*                       precision, meaning that the matrix is singular
*                       to working precision.  Nevertheless, the
*                       solution and error bounds are computed because
*                       there are a number of situations where the
*                       computed solution can be more accurate than the
*                       value of RCOND would suggest.

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE ZSYSVXX( FACT, UPLO, N, NRHS, A, LDA, AF, LDAF, IPIV, EQUED, S, B, LDB, X, LDX, RCOND, RPVGRW, BERR, N_ERR_BNDS, ERR_BNDS_NORM, ERR_BNDS_COMP, NPARAMS, PARAMS, WORK, RWORK, INFO )

*     Purpose
*     =======
*
*     ZSYSVXX uses the diagonal pivoting factorization to compute the
*     solution to a complex*16 system of linear equations A * X = B, where
*     A is an N-by-N symmetric matrix and X and B are N-by-NRHS
*     matrices.
*
*     If requested, both normwise and maximum componentwise error bounds
*     are returned. ZSYSVXX will return a solution with a tiny
*     guaranteed error (O(eps) where eps is the working machine
*     precision) unless the matrix is very ill-conditioned, in which
*     case a warning is returned. Relevant condition numbers also are
*     calculated and returned.
*
*     ZSYSVXX accepts user-provided factorizations and equilibration
*     factors; see the definitions of the FACT and EQUED options.
*     Solving with refinement and using a factorization from a previous
*     ZSYSVXX call will also produce a solution with either O(eps)
*     errors or warnings, but we cannot make that claim for general
*     user-provided factorizations and equilibration factors if they
*     differ from what ZSYSVXX would itself produce.
*
*     Description
*     ===========
*
*     The following steps are performed:
*
*     1. If FACT = 'E', double precision scaling factors are computed to equilibrate
*     the system:
*
*       diag(S)*A*diag(S)     *inv(diag(S))*X = diag(S)*B
*
*     Whether or not the system will be equilibrated depends on the
*     scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, A is
*     overwritten by diag(S)*A*diag(S) and B by diag(S)*B.
*
*     2. If FACT = 'N' or 'E', the LU decomposition is used to factor
*     the matrix A (after equilibration if FACT = 'E') as
*
*        A = U * D * U**T,  if UPLO = 'U', or
*        A = L * D * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
*
*     where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
*     triangular matrices, and D is symmetric and block diagonal with
*     1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.
*
*     3. If some D(i,i)=0, so that D is exactly singular, then the
*     routine returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored form of A
*     is used to estimate the condition number of the matrix A (see
*     argument RCOND).  If the reciprocal of the condition number is
*     less than machine precision, the routine still goes on to solve
*     for X and compute error bounds as described below.
*
*     4. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
*     of A.
*
*     5. By default (unless PARAMS(LA_LINRX_ITREF_I) is set to zero),
*     the routine will use iterative refinement to try to get a small
*     error and error bounds.  Refinement calculates the residual to at
*     least twice the working precision.
*
*     6. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by
*     diag(R) so that it solves the original system before
*     equilibration.
*

*     Arguments
*     =========
*
*     Some optional parameters are bundled in the PARAMS array.  These
*     settings determine how refinement is performed, but often the
*     defaults are acceptable.  If the defaults are acceptable, users
*     can pass NPARAMS = 0 which prevents the source code from accessing
*     the PARAMS argument.
*
*     FACT    (input) CHARACTER*1
*     Specifies whether or not the factored form of the matrix A is
*     supplied on entry, and if not, whether the matrix A should be
*     equilibrated before it is factored.
*       = 'F':  On entry, AF and IPIV contain the factored form of A.
*               If EQUED is not 'N', the matrix A has been
*               equilibrated with scaling factors given by S.
*               A, AF, and IPIV are not modified.
*       = 'N':  The matrix A will be copied to AF and factored.
*       = 'E':  The matrix A will be equilibrated if necessary, then
*               copied to AF and factored.
*
*     UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*       = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
*       = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
*
*     N       (input) INTEGER
*     The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
*     matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*     NRHS    (input) INTEGER
*     The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
*     of the matrices B and X.  NRHS >= 0.
*
*     A       (input/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
*     The symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading N-by-N
*     upper triangular part of A contains the upper triangular
*     part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower triangular
*     part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the leading
*     N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
*     triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
*     triangular part of A is not referenced.
*
*     On exit, if FACT = 'E' and EQUED = 'Y', A is overwritten by
*     diag(S)*A*diag(S).
*
*     LDA     (input) INTEGER
*     The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
*
*     AF      (input or output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDAF,N)
*     If FACT = 'F', then AF is an input argument and on entry
*     contains the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers
*     used to obtain the factor U or L from the factorization A =
*     U*D*U**T or A = L*D*L**T as computed by DSYTRF.
*
*     If FACT = 'N', then AF is an output argument and on exit
*     returns the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers
*     used to obtain the factor U or L from the factorization A =

*     IPIV    (input or output) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*     If FACT = 'F', then IPIV is an input argument and on entry
*     contains details of the interchanges and the block
*     structure of D, as determined by DSYTRF.  If IPIV(k) > 0,
*     then rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were interchanged and
*     D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'U' and
*     IPIV(k) = IPIV(k-1) < 0, then rows and columns k-1 and
*     -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k-1:k,k-1:k) is a 2-by-2
*     diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'L' and IPIV(k) = IPIV(k+1) < 0,
*     then rows and columns k+1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged
*     and D(k:k+1,k:k+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.
*
*     If FACT = 'N', then IPIV is an output argument and on exit
*     contains details of the interchanges and the block
*     structure of D, as determined by DSYTRF.
*
*     EQUED   (input or output) CHARACTER*1
*     Specifies the form of equilibration that was done.
*       = 'N':  No equilibration (always true if FACT = 'N').
*       = 'Y':  Both row and column equilibration, i.e., A has been
*               replaced by diag(S) * A * diag(S).
*     EQUED is an input argument if FACT = 'F'; otherwise, it is an
*     output argument.
*
*     S       (input or output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*     The scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'Y', A is multiplied on
*     the left and right by diag(S).  S is an input argument if FACT =
*     'F'; otherwise, S is an output argument.  If FACT = 'F' and EQUED
*     = 'Y', each element of S must be positive.  If S is output, each
*     element of S is a power of the radix. If S is input, each element
*     of S should be a power of the radix to ensure a reliable solution
*     and error estimates. Scaling by powers of the radix does not cause
*     rounding errors unless the result underflows or overflows.
*     Rounding errors during scaling lead to refining with a matrix that
*     is not equivalent to the input matrix, producing error estimates
*     that may not be reliable.
*
*     B       (input/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
*     On entry, the N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.
*     On exit,
*     if EQUED = 'N', B is not modified;
*     if EQUED = 'Y', B is overwritten by diag(S)*B;
*
*     LDB     (input) INTEGER
*     The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
*
*     X       (output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
*     If INFO = 0, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X to the original
*     system of equations.  Note that A and B are modified on exit if
*     EQUED .ne. 'N', and the solution to the equilibrated system is
*     inv(diag(S))*X.
*
*     LDX     (input) INTEGER
*     The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
*
*     RCOND   (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*     Reciprocal scaled condition number.  This is an estimate of the
*     reciprocal Skeel condition number of the matrix A after
*     equilibration (if done).  If this is less than the machine
*     precision (in particular, if it is zero), the matrix is singular
*     to working precision.  Note that the error may still be small even
*     if this number is very small and the matrix appears ill-
*     conditioned.
*
*     RPVGRW  (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*     Reciprocal pivot growth.  On exit, this contains the reciprocal
*     pivot growth factor norm(A)/norm(U). The "max absolute element"
*     norm is used.  If this is much less than 1, then the stability of
*     the LU factorization of the (equilibrated) matrix A could be poor.
*     This also means that the solution X, estimated condition numbers,
*     and error bounds could be unreliable. If factorization fails with
*     0<INFO<=N, then this contains the reciprocal pivot growth factor
*     for the leading INFO columns of A.
*
*     BERR    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
*     Componentwise relative backward error.  This is the
*     componentwise relative backward error of each solution vector X(j)
*     (i.e., the smallest relative change in any element of A or B that
*     makes X(j) an exact solution).
*
*     N_ERR_BNDS (input) INTEGER
*     Number of error bounds to return for each right hand side
*     and each type (normwise or componentwise).  See ERR_BNDS_NORM and
*     ERR_BNDS_COMP below.
*
*     ERR_BNDS_NORM  (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
*     For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
*     various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
*     normwise relative error, which is defined as follows:
*
*     Normwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
*             max_j (abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i)))
*            ------------------------------
*                  max_j abs(X(j,i))
*
*     The array is indexed by the type of error information as described
*     below. There currently are up to three pieces of information
*     returned.
*
*     The first index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(i,:) corresponds to the ith
*     right-hand side.
*
*     The second index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,err) contains the following
*     three fields:
*     err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
*              reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
*              sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon').
*
*     err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
*              almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
*              so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
*              sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
*              be trusted if the previous boolean is true.
*
*     err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated normwise
*              reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
*              sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
*              estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
*              numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
*              appropriately scaled matrix Z.
*              Let Z = S*A, where S scales each row by a power of the
*              radix so all absolute row sums of Z are approximately 1.
*
*     See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
*     cautions.
*
*     ERR_BNDS_COMP  (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
*     For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
*     various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
*     componentwise relative error, which is defined as follows:
*
*     Componentwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
*                    abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i))
*             max_j ----------------------
*                         abs(X(j,i))
*
*     The array is indexed by the right-hand side i (on which the
*     componentwise relative error depends), and the type of error
*     information as described below. There currently are up to three
*     pieces of information returned for each right-hand side. If
*     componentwise accuracy is not requested (PARAMS(3) = 0.0), then
*     ERR_BNDS_COMP is not accessed.  If N_ERR_BNDS .LT. 3, then at most
*     the first (:,N_ERR_BNDS) entries are returned.
*
*     The first index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(i,:) corresponds to the ith
*     right-hand side.
*
*     The second index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,err) contains the following
*     three fields:
*     err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
*              reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
*              sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon').
*

*              almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
*              so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
*              sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
*              be trusted if the previous boolean is true.
*
*     err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated componentwise
*              reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
*              sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error

*              numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
*              appropriately scaled matrix Z.
*              Let Z = S*(A*diag(x)), where x is the solution for the
*              current right-hand side and S scales each row of
*              A*diag(x) by a power of the radix so all absolute row
*              sums of Z are approximately 1.
*
*     See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
*     cautions.
*
*     NPARAMS (input) INTEGER
*     Specifies the number of parameters set in PARAMS.  If .LE. 0, the
*     PARAMS array is never referenced and default values are used.
*
*     PARAMS  (input / output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension NPARAMS
*     Specifies algorithm parameters.  If an entry is .LT. 0.0, then
*     that entry will be filled with default value used for that
*     parameter.  Only positions up to NPARAMS are accessed; defaults
*     are used for higher-numbered parameters.
*
*       PARAMS(LA_LINRX_ITREF_I = 1) : Whether to perform iterative
*            refinement or not.
*         Default: 1.0D+0
*            = 0.0 : No refinement is performed, and no error bounds are
*                    computed.
*            = 1.0 : Use the extra-precise refinement algorithm.
*              (other values are reserved for future use)
*
*       PARAMS(LA_LINRX_ITHRESH_I = 2) : Maximum number of residual
*            computations allowed for refinement.
*         Default: 10
*         Aggressive: Set to 100 to permit convergence using approximate
*                     factorizations or factorizations other than LU. If
*                     the factorization uses a technique other than
*                     Gaussian elimination, the guarantees in
*                     err_bnds_norm and err_bnds_comp may no longer be
*                     trustworthy.
*
*       PARAMS(LA_LINRX_CWISE_I = 3) : Flag determining if the code
*            will attempt to find a solution with small componentwise
*            relative error in the double-precision algorithm.  Positive
*            is true, 0.0 is false.
*         Default: 1.0 (attempt componentwise convergence)
*

*
*     RWORK   (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (2*N)
*
*     INFO    (output) INTEGER
*       = 0:  Successful exit. The solution to every right-hand side is
*         guaranteed.
*       < 0:  If INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*       > 0 and <= N:  U(INFO,INFO) is exactly zero.  The factorization
*         has been completed, but the factor U is exactly singular, so
*         the solution and error bounds could not be computed. RCOND = 0
*         is returned.
*       = N+J: The solution corresponding to the Jth right-hand side is
*         not guaranteed. The solutions corresponding to other right-
*         hand sides K with K > J may not be guaranteed as well, but
*         only the first such right-hand side is reported. If a small
*         componentwise error is not requested (PARAMS(3) = 0.0) then
*         the Jth right-hand side is the first with a normwise error
*         bound that is not guaranteed (the smallest J such
*         that ERR_BNDS_NORM(J,1) = 0.0). By default (PARAMS(3) = 1.0)
*         the Jth right-hand side is the first with either a normwise or

*         J such that either ERR_BNDS_NORM(J,1) = 0.0 or

*  =======

*  This is the unblocked version of the algorithm, calling Level 2 BLAS.
*

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE ZSYTRF( UPLO, N, A, LDA, IPIV, WORK, LWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  ZSYTRF computes the factorization of a complex symmetric matrix A
*  using the Bunch-Kaufman diagonal pivoting method.  The form of the
*  factorization is
*
*     A = U*D*U**T  or  A = L*D*L**T
*
*  where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
*  triangular matrices, and D is symmetric and block diagonal with
*  with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.
*
*  This is the blocked version of the algorithm, calling Level 3 BLAS.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
*          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  A       (input/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          On entry, the symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
*          N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the upper
*          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
*          triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
*          leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
*          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
*          triangular part of A is not referenced.
*
*          On exit, the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used
*          to obtain the factor U or L (see below for further details).
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
*
*  IPIV    (output) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*          Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D.
*          If IPIV(k) > 0, then rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were
*          interchanged and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.
*          If UPLO = 'U' and IPIV(k) = IPIV(k-1) < 0, then rows and
*          columns k-1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k-1:k,k-1:k)
*          is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'L' and IPIV(k) =
*          IPIV(k+1) < 0, then rows and columns k+1 and -IPIV(k) were
*          interchanged and D(k:k+1,k:k+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.
*
*  WORK    (workspace/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
*
*  LWORK   (input) INTEGER
*          The length of WORK.  LWORK >=1.  For best performance
*          LWORK >= N*NB, where NB is the block size returned by ILAENV.
*
*          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
*          only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
*          this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
*          message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0:  if INFO = i, D(i,i) is exactly zero.  The factorization
*                has been completed, but the block diagonal matrix D is
*                exactly singular, and division by zero will occur if it
*                is used to solve a system of equations.

      SUBROUTINE ZSYTRI2( UPLO, N, A, LDA, IPIV, WORK, LWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  ZSYTRI2 computes the inverse of a complex symmetric indefinite matrix
*  A using the factorization A = U*D*U**T or A = L*D*L**T computed by
*  ZSYTRF. ZSYTRI2 sets the LEADING DIMENSION of the workspace
*  before calling ZSYTRI2X that actually computes the inverse.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies whether the details of the factorization are stored
*          as an upper or lower triangular matrix.
*          = 'U':  Upper triangular, form is A = U*D*U**T;
*          = 'L':  Lower triangular, form is A = L*D*L**T.

*          matrix.  If UPLO = 'U', the upper triangular part of the
*          inverse is formed and the part of A below the diagonal is not
*          referenced; if UPLO = 'L' the lower triangular part of the
*          inverse is formed and the part of A above the diagonal is
*          not referenced.

*  WORK    (workspace) DOUBLE COMPLEX array, dimension (N+NB+1)*(NB+3)
*
*  LWORK   (input) INTEGER
*          The dimension of the array WORK.
*          WORK is size >= (N+NB+1)*(NB+3)
*          If LDWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
*           calculates:
*              - the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
*          this value as the first entry of the WORK array,
*              - and no error message related to LDWORK is issued by XERBLA.
*

*          = 0: successful exit
*          < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0: if INFO = i, D(i,i) = 0; the matrix is singular and its
*               inverse could not be computed.
