      SUBROUTINE DPOCON( UPLO, N, A, LDA, ANORM, RCOND, WORK, IWORK, INFO )

*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
*
*  ANORM   (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The 1-norm (or infinity-norm) of the symmetric matrix A.
*
*  RCOND   (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A,
*          computed as RCOND = 1/(ANORM * AINVNM), where AINVNM is an
*          estimate of the 1-norm of inv(A) computed in this routine.

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE DPOEQU( N, A, LDA, S, SCOND, AMAX, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DPOEQU computes row and column scalings intended to equilibrate a
*  symmetric positive definite matrix A and reduce its condition number
*  (with respect to the two-norm).  S contains the scale factors,
*  S(i) = 1/sqrt(A(i,i)), chosen so that the scaled matrix B with
*  elements B(i,j) = S(i)*A(i,j)*S(j) has ones on the diagonal.  This
*  choice of S puts the condition number of B within a factor N of the
*  smallest possible condition number over all possible diagonal
*  scalings.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  A       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          The N-by-N symmetric positive definite matrix whose scaling
*          factors are to be computed.  Only the diagonal elements of A
*          are referenced.

*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
*
*  S       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          If INFO = 0, S contains the scale factors for A.
*
*  SCOND   (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          If INFO = 0, S contains the ratio of the smallest S(i) to
*          the largest S(i).  If SCOND >= 0.1 and AMAX is neither too
*          large nor too small, it is not worth scaling by S.
*
*  AMAX    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          Absolute value of largest matrix element.  If AMAX is very
*          close to overflow or very close to underflow, the matrix
*          should be scaled.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0:  if INFO = i, the i-th diagonal element is nonpositive.

FORTRAN MANUAL

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DPOSV computes the solution to a real system of linear equations
*     A * X = B,
*  where A is an N-by-N symmetric positive definite matrix and X and B
*  are N-by-NRHS matrices.
*
*  The Cholesky decomposition is used to factor A as

*     A = L * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
*  where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is a lower triangular
*  matrix.  The factored form of A is then used to solve the system of

  Solves a symmetric positive definite system of linear
  <PRE>
USAGE:
  x, rcond, ferr, berr, info, a, af, equed, s, b = NumRu::Lapack.dposvx( fact, uplo, a, af, equed, s, b)

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE DPOSVX( FACT, UPLO, N, NRHS, A, LDA, AF, LDAF, EQUED, S, B, LDB, X, LDX, RCOND, FERR, BERR, WORK, IWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DPOSVX uses the Cholesky factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T to
*  compute the solution to a real system of linear equations
*     A * X = B,
*  where A is an N-by-N symmetric positive definite matrix and X and B
*  are N-by-NRHS matrices.
*
*  Error bounds on the solution and a condition estimate are also
*  provided.
*
*  Description
*  ===========
*
*  The following steps are performed:
*
*  1. If FACT = 'E', real scaling factors are computed to equilibrate
*     the system:
*        diag(S) * A * diag(S) * inv(diag(S)) * X = diag(S) * B
*     Whether or not the system will be equilibrated depends on the
*     scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, A is
*     overwritten by diag(S)*A*diag(S) and B by diag(S)*B.
*
*  2. If FACT = 'N' or 'E', the Cholesky decomposition is used to
*     factor the matrix A (after equilibration if FACT = 'E') as
*        A = U**T* U,  if UPLO = 'U', or
*        A = L * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
*     where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is a lower triangular
*     matrix.
*
*  3. If the leading i-by-i principal minor is not positive definite,
*     then the routine returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored
*     form of A is used to estimate the condition number of the matrix
*     A.  If the reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine
*     precision, INFO = N+1 is returned as a warning, but the routine
*     still goes on to solve for X and compute error bounds as
*     described below.
*
*  4. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
*     of A.
*
*  5. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution
*     matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates
*     for it.
*
*  6. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by
*     diag(S) so that it solves the original system before
*     equilibration.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  FACT    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies whether or not the factored form of the matrix A is
*          supplied on entry, and if not, whether the matrix A should be
*          equilibrated before it is factored.
*          = 'F':  On entry, AF contains the factored form of A.
*                  If EQUED = 'Y', the matrix A has been equilibrated
*                  with scaling factors given by S.  A and AF will not
*                  be modified.
*          = 'N':  The matrix A will be copied to AF and factored.
*          = 'E':  The matrix A will be equilibrated if necessary, then

*          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
*          triangular part of A is not referenced.  A is not modified if
*          FACT = 'F' or 'N', or if FACT = 'E' and EQUED = 'N' on exit.
*
*          On exit, if FACT = 'E' and EQUED = 'Y', A is overwritten by

*          factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T, in the same storage
*          format as A.  If EQUED .ne. 'N', then AF is the factored form
*          of the equilibrated matrix diag(S)*A*diag(S).
*
*          If FACT = 'N', then AF is an output argument and on exit
*          returns the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky
*          factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T of the original
*          matrix A.
*
*          If FACT = 'E', then AF is an output argument and on exit
*          returns the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky
*          factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T of the equilibrated
*          matrix A (see the description of A for the form of the
*          equilibrated matrix).

*          The leading dimension of the array AF.  LDAF >= max(1,N).
*
*  EQUED   (input or output) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies the form of equilibration that was done.
*          = 'N':  No equilibration (always true if FACT = 'N').
*          = 'Y':  Equilibration was done, i.e., A has been replaced by
*                  diag(S) * A * diag(S).
*          EQUED is an input argument if FACT = 'F'; otherwise, it is an
*          output argument.
*
*  S       (input or output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          The scale factors for A; not accessed if EQUED = 'N'.  S is
*          an input argument if FACT = 'F'; otherwise, S is an output
*          argument.  If FACT = 'F' and EQUED = 'Y', each element of S
*          must be positive.
*
*  B       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)

*
*  RCOND   (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The estimate of the reciprocal condition number of the matrix
*          A after equilibration (if done).  If RCOND is less than the
*          machine precision (in particular, if RCOND = 0), the matrix
*          is singular to working precision.  This condition is
*          indicated by a return code of INFO > 0.
*
*  FERR    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
*          The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector

*          If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
