FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE DGTTRF( N, DL, D, DU, DU2, IPIV, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DGTTRF computes an LU factorization of a real tridiagonal matrix A
*  using elimination with partial pivoting and row interchanges.
*
*  The factorization has the form
*     A = L * U
*  where L is a product of permutation and unit lower bidiagonal
*  matrices and U is upper triangular with nonzeros in only the main
*  diagonal and first two superdiagonals.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.
*
*  DL      (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1)
*          On entry, DL must contain the (n-1) sub-diagonal elements of
*          A.
*
*          On exit, DL is overwritten by the (n-1) multipliers that
*          define the matrix L from the LU factorization of A.
*
*  D       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          On entry, D must contain the diagonal elements of A.
*
*          On exit, D is overwritten by the n diagonal elements of the
*          upper triangular matrix U from the LU factorization of A.
*
*  DU      (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1)
*          On entry, DU must contain the (n-1) super-diagonal elements
*          of A.
*
*          On exit, DU is overwritten by the (n-1) elements of the first
*          super-diagonal of U.
*
*  DU2     (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-2)
*          On exit, DU2 is overwritten by the (n-2) elements of the
*          second super-diagonal of U.
*
*  IPIV    (output) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*          The pivot indices; for 1 <= i <= n, row i of the matrix was
*          interchanged with row IPIV(i).  IPIV(i) will always be either
*          i or i+1; IPIV(i) = i indicates a row interchange was not
*          required.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -k, the k-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0:  if INFO = k, U(k,k) is exactly zero. The factorization
*                has been completed, but the factor U is exactly
*                singular, and division by zero will occur if it is used
*                to solve a system of equations.

      SUBROUTINE DGTSVX( FACT, TRANS, N, NRHS, DL, D, DU, DLF, DF, DUF, DU2, IPIV, B, LDB, X, LDX, RCOND, FERR, BERR, WORK, IWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DGTSVX uses the LU factorization to compute the solution to a real
*  system of linear equations A * X = B or A**T * X = B,
*  where A is a tridiagonal matrix of order N and X and B are N-by-NRHS
*  matrices.
*
*  Error bounds on the solution and a condition estimate are also
*  provided.
*
*  Description
*  ===========
*
*  The following steps are performed:
*
*  1. If FACT = 'N', the LU decomposition is used to factor the matrix A
*     as A = L * U, where L is a product of permutation and unit lower
*     bidiagonal matrices and U is upper triangular with nonzeros in
*     only the main diagonal and first two superdiagonals.
*
*  2. If some U(i,i)=0, so that U is exactly singular, then the routine
*     returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored form of A is used
*     to estimate the condition number of the matrix A.  If the
*     reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine precision,
*     INFO = N+1 is returned as a warning, but the routine still goes on
*     to solve for X and compute error bounds as described below.
*
*  3. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
*     of A.
*
*  4. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution
*     matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates
*     for it.
*

*                  will not be modified.

*
*  RCOND   (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The estimate of the reciprocal condition number of the matrix
*          A.  If RCOND is less than the machine precision (in
*          particular, if RCOND = 0), the matrix is singular to working
*          precision.  This condition is indicated by a return code of
*          INFO > 0.
*
*  FERR    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
*          The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
*          X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
*          If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
*          is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
*          element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
*          largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
*          the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight
*          overestimate of the true error.
*
*  BERR    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
*          The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
*          vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
*          any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).
*
*  WORK    (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (3*N)
*
*  IWORK   (workspace) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0:  if INFO = i, and i is
*                <= N:  U(i,i) is exactly zero.  The factorization
*                       has not been completed unless i = N, but the
*                       factor U is exactly singular, so the solution
*                       and error bounds could not be computed.
*                       RCOND = 0 is returned.
*                = N+1: U is nonsingular, but RCOND is less than machine
*                       precision, meaning that the matrix is singular
*                       to working precision.  Nevertheless, the
*                       solution and error bounds are computed because
*                       there are a number of situations where the
*                       computed solution can be more accurate than the
*                       value of RCOND would suggest.

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DGTRFS improves the computed solution to a system of linear

*          Specifies the form of the system of equations:

*
*  NRHS    (input) INTEGER
*          The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
