*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  CHEEVD computes all eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors of a

*  digit in add/subtract, or on those binary machines without guard
*  digits which subtract like the Cray X-MP, Cray Y-MP, Cray C-90, or
*  Cray-2. It could conceivably fail on hexadecimal or decimal machines
*  without guard digits, but we know of none.

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE CHEEVR( JOBZ, RANGE, UPLO, N, A, LDA, VL, VU, IL, IU, ABSTOL, M, W, Z, LDZ, ISUPPZ, WORK, LWORK, RWORK, LRWORK, IWORK, LIWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  CHEEVR computes selected eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors
*  of a complex Hermitian matrix A.  Eigenvalues and eigenvectors can
*  be selected by specifying either a range of values or a range of
*  indices for the desired eigenvalues.
*
*  CHEEVR first reduces the matrix A to tridiagonal form T with a call
*  to CHETRD.  Then, whenever possible, CHEEVR calls CSTEMR to compute
*  the eigenspectrum using Relatively Robust Representations.  CSTEMR
*  computes eigenvalues by the dqds algorithm, while orthogonal
*  eigenvectors are computed from various "good" L D L^T representations
*  (also known as Relatively Robust Representations). Gram-Schmidt
*  orthogonalization is avoided as far as possible. More specifically,
*  the various steps of the algorithm are as follows.
*
*  For each unreduced block (submatrix) of T,
*     (a) Compute T - sigma I  = L D L^T, so that L and D
*         define all the wanted eigenvalues to high relative accuracy.
*         This means that small relative changes in the entries of D and L
*         cause only small relative changes in the eigenvalues and
*         eigenvectors. The standard (unfactored) representation of the
*         tridiagonal matrix T does not have this property in general.
*     (b) Compute the eigenvalues to suitable accuracy.
*         If the eigenvectors are desired, the algorithm attains full
*         accuracy of the computed eigenvalues only right before
*         the corresponding vectors have to be computed, see steps c) and d).
*     (c) For each cluster of close eigenvalues, select a new
*         shift close to the cluster, find a new factorization, and refine
*         the shifted eigenvalues to suitable accuracy.
*     (d) For each eigenvalue with a large enough relative separation compute
*         the corresponding eigenvector by forming a rank revealing twisted
*         factorization. Go back to (c) for any clusters that remain.
*
*  The desired accuracy of the output can be specified by the input
*  parameter ABSTOL.

*
*
*  Note 1 : CHEEVR calls CSTEMR when the full spectrum is requested
*  on machines which conform to the ieee-754 floating point standard.
*  CHEEVR calls SSTEBZ and CSTEIN on non-ieee machines and
*  when partial spectrum requests are made.
*
*  Normal execution of CSTEMR may create NaNs and infinities and
*  hence may abort due to a floating point exception in environments
*  which do not handle NaNs and infinities in the ieee standard default
*  manner.

*          triangle (if UPLO='U') of A, including the diagonal, is
*          destroyed.
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
*
*  VL      (input) REAL
*  VU      (input) REAL
*          If RANGE='V', the lower and upper bounds of the interval to

*
*                  ABSTOL + EPS *   max( |a|,|b| ) ,

*          with Guaranteed High Relative Accuracy," by Demmel and

*
*          If high relative accuracy is important, set ABSTOL to

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  CHEEVX computes selected eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors
*  of a complex Hermitian matrix A.  Eigenvalues and eigenvectors can
*  be selected by specifying either a range of values or a range of
*  indices for the desired eigenvalues.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  JOBZ    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'N':  Compute eigenvalues only;
*          = 'V':  Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
*
*  RANGE   (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'A': all eigenvalues will be found.
*          = 'V': all eigenvalues in the half-open interval (VL,VU]
*                 will be found.
*          = 'I': the IL-th through IU-th eigenvalues will be found.
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
*          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  A       (input/output) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA, N)
*          On entry, the Hermitian matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the
*          leading N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the

*          On exit, the lower triangle (if UPLO='L') or the upper

*
*  ABSTOL  (input) REAL
*          The absolute error tolerance for the eigenvalues.
*          An approximate eigenvalue is accepted as converged
*          when it is determined to lie in an interval [a,b]
*          of width less than or equal to
*
*                  ABSTOL + EPS *   max( |a|,|b| ) ,
*
*          where EPS is the machine precision.  If ABSTOL is less than
*          or equal to zero, then  EPS*|T|  will be used in its place,
*          where |T| is the 1-norm of the tridiagonal matrix obtained
*          by reducing A to tridiagonal form.
*
*          Eigenvalues will be computed most accurately when ABSTOL is
*          set to twice the underflow threshold 2*SLAMCH('S'), not zero.
*          If this routine returns with INFO>0, indicating that some
*          eigenvectors did not converge, try setting ABSTOL to
*          2*SLAMCH('S').

*          CUNMTR as returned by ILAENV.
*
*          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE CHEGVD( ITYPE, JOBZ, UPLO, N, A, LDA, B, LDB, W, WORK, LWORK, RWORK, LRWORK, IWORK, LIWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  CHEGVD computes all the eigenvalues, and optionally, the eigenvectors
*  of a complex generalized Hermitian-definite eigenproblem, of the form
*  A*x=(lambda)*B*x,  A*Bx=(lambda)*x,  or B*A*x=(lambda)*x.  Here A and
*  B are assumed to be Hermitian and B is also positive definite.
*  If eigenvectors are desired, it uses a divide and conquer algorithm.
*
*  The divide and conquer algorithm makes very mild assumptions about
*  floating point arithmetic. It will work on machines with a guard
*  digit in add/subtract, or on those binary machines without guard
*  digits which subtract like the Cray X-MP, Cray Y-MP, Cray C-90, or
*  Cray-2. It could conceivably fail on hexadecimal or decimal machines
*  without guard digits, but we know of none.

*     A * X = B,
*  where A is an N-by-N Hermitian matrix and X and B are N-by-NRHS
*  matrices.
*
*  The diagonal pivoting method is used to factor A as

*  where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
*  triangular matrices, and D is Hermitian and block diagonal with

*

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE CHESVX( FACT, UPLO, N, NRHS, A, LDA, AF, LDAF, IPIV, B, LDB, X, LDX, RCOND, FERR, BERR, WORK, LWORK, RWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  CHESVX uses the diagonal pivoting factorization to compute the
*  solution to a complex system of linear equations A * X = B,
*  where A is an N-by-N Hermitian matrix and X and B are N-by-NRHS
*  matrices.
*
*  Error bounds on the solution and a condition estimate are also
*  provided.
*
*  Description
*  ===========
*
*  The following steps are performed:
*
*  1. If FACT = 'N', the diagonal pivoting method is used to factor A.
*     The form of the factorization is
*        A = U * D * U**H,  if UPLO = 'U', or
*        A = L * D * L**H,  if UPLO = 'L',
*     where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
*     triangular matrices, and D is Hermitian and block diagonal with
*     1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.
*
*  2. If some D(i,i)=0, so that D is exactly singular, then the routine
*     returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored form of A is used
*     to estimate the condition number of the matrix A.  If the
*     reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine precision,
*     INFO = N+1 is returned as a warning, but the routine still goes on
*     to solve for X and compute error bounds as described below.
*
*  3. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
*     of A.
*
*  4. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution
*     matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates
*     for it.
*

*  Arguments

*
*  FACT    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies whether or not the factored form of A has been
*          supplied on entry.
*          = 'F':  On entry, AF and IPIV contain the factored form
*                  of A.  A, AF and IPIV will not be modified.
*          = 'N':  The matrix A will be copied to AF and factored.

*
*  A       (input) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          The Hermitian matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading N-by-N
*          upper triangular part of A contains the upper triangular part
*          of the matrix A, and the strictly lower triangular part of A
*          is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the leading N-by-N lower
*          triangular part of A contains the lower triangular part of
*          the matrix A, and the strictly upper triangular part of A is
*          not referenced.

*          contains the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used
*          to obtain the factor U or L from the factorization
*          A = U*D*U**H or A = L*D*L**H as computed by CHETRF.
*
*          If FACT = 'N', then AF is an output argument and on exit
*          returns the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used
*          to obtain the factor U or L from the factorization
*          A = U*D*U**H or A = L*D*L**H.
*
*  LDAF    (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array AF.  LDAF >= max(1,N).
*
*  IPIV    (input or output) INTEGER array, dimension (N)

*          contains details of the interchanges and the block structure
*          of D, as determined by CHETRF.
*          If IPIV(k) > 0, then rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were
*          interchanged and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.
*          If UPLO = 'U' and IPIV(k) = IPIV(k-1) < 0, then rows and
*          columns k-1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k-1:k,k-1:k)
*          is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'L' and IPIV(k) =
*          IPIV(k+1) < 0, then rows and columns k+1 and -IPIV(k) were
*          interchanged and D(k:k+1,k:k+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.
*
*          If FACT = 'N', then IPIV is an output argument and on exit
*          contains details of the interchanges and the block structure
*          of D, as determined by CHETRF.
*
*  B       (input) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
*          The N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.
*
*  LDB     (input) INTEGER

*          The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
*
*  RCOND   (output) REAL
*          The estimate of the reciprocal condition number of the matrix
*          A.  If RCOND is less than the machine precision (in
*          particular, if RCOND = 0), the matrix is singular to working
*          precision.  This condition is indicated by a return code of
*          INFO > 0.
*
*  FERR    (output) REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
*          The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
*          X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
*          If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
*          is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
*          element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
*          largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as

*          overestimate of the true error.
*
*  BERR    (output) REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
*          The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
*          vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
*          any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).
*
*  WORK    (workspace/output) COMPLEX array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
*
*  LWORK   (input) INTEGER
*          The length of WORK.  LWORK >= max(1,2*N), and for best
*          performance, when FACT = 'N', LWORK >= max(1,2*N,N*NB), where
*          NB is the optimal blocksize for CHETRF.
*
*          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
*          only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
*          this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
*          message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
*
*  RWORK   (workspace) REAL array, dimension (N)
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0: successful exit
*          < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0: if INFO = i, and i is
*                <= N:  D(i,i) is exactly zero.  The factorization
*                       has been completed but the factor D is exactly
*                       singular, so the solution and error bounds could
*                       not be computed. RCOND = 0 is returned.
*                = N+1: D is nonsingular, but RCOND is less than machine
*                       precision, meaning that the matrix is singular
*                       to working precision.  Nevertheless, the
*                       solution and error bounds are computed because
*                       there are a number of situations where the
*                       computed solution can be more accurate than the
*                       value of RCOND would suggest.

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE CHETF2( UPLO, N, A, LDA, IPIV, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  CHETF2 computes the factorization of a complex Hermitian matrix A
*  using the Bunch-Kaufman diagonal pivoting method:
*
*     A = U*D*U'  or  A = L*D*L'
*
*  where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
*  triangular matrices, U' is the conjugate transpose of U, and D is
*  Hermitian and block diagonal with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.
*
*  This is the unblocked version of the algorithm, calling Level 2 BLAS.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies whether the upper or lower triangular part of the
*          Hermitian matrix A is stored:
*          = 'U':  Upper triangular
*          = 'L':  Lower triangular
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  A       (input/output) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          On entry, the Hermitian matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
*          n-by-n upper triangular part of A contains the upper
*          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
*          triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
*          leading n-by-n lower triangular part of A contains the lower
*          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
*          triangular part of A is not referenced.
*
*          On exit, the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used
*          to obtain the factor U or L (see below for further details).
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
*
*  IPIV    (output) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*          Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D.
*          If IPIV(k) > 0, then rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were
*          interchanged and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.
*          If UPLO = 'U' and IPIV(k) = IPIV(k-1) < 0, then rows and
*          columns k-1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k-1:k,k-1:k)
*          is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'L' and IPIV(k) =
*          IPIV(k+1) < 0, then rows and columns k+1 and -IPIV(k) were
*          interchanged and D(k:k+1,k:k+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0: successful exit
*          < 0: if INFO = -k, the k-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0: if INFO = k, D(k,k) is exactly zero.  The factorization
*               has been completed, but the block diagonal matrix D is
*               exactly singular, and division by zero will occur if it
*               is used to solve a system of equations.

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE CHETRS( UPLO, N, NRHS, A, LDA, IPIV, B, LDB, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  CHETRS solves a system of linear equations A*X = B with a complex
*  Hermitian matrix A using the factorization A = U*D*U**H or
*  A = L*D*L**H computed by CHETRF.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies whether the details of the factorization are stored
*          as an upper or lower triangular matrix.
*          = 'U':  Upper triangular, form is A = U*D*U**H;
*          = 'L':  Lower triangular, form is A = L*D*L**H.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  NRHS    (input) INTEGER
*          The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
*          of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.
*
*  A       (input) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          The block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used to
*          obtain the factor U or L as computed by CHETRF.
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
*
*  IPIV    (input) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*          Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D
*          as determined by CHETRF.
*
*  B       (input/output) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
*          On entry, the right hand side matrix B.
*          On exit, the solution matrix X.
*
*  LDB     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
