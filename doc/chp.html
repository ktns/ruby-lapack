FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE CHPSVX( FACT, UPLO, N, NRHS, AP, AFP, IPIV, B, LDB, X, LDX, RCOND, FERR, BERR, WORK, RWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  CHPSVX uses the diagonal pivoting factorization A = U*D*U**H or
*  A = L*D*L**H to compute the solution to a complex system of linear
*  equations A * X = B, where A is an N-by-N Hermitian matrix stored
*  in packed format and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.
*
*  Error bounds on the solution and a condition estimate are also
*  provided.
*
*  Description
*  ===========
*
*  The following steps are performed:
*
*  1. If FACT = 'N', the diagonal pivoting method is used to factor A as
*        A = U * D * U**H,  if UPLO = 'U', or
*        A = L * D * L**H,  if UPLO = 'L',
*     where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
*     triangular matrices and D is Hermitian and block diagonal with
*     1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.
*
*  2. If some D(i,i)=0, so that D is exactly singular, then the routine
*     returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored form of A is used
*     to estimate the condition number of the matrix A.  If the
*     reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine precision,
*     INFO = N+1 is returned as a warning, but the routine still goes on
*     to solve for X and compute error bounds as described below.
*
*  3. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
*     of A.
*
*  4. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution
*     matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates
*     for it.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  FACT    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies whether or not the factored form of A has been
*          supplied on entry.
*          = 'F':  On entry, AFP and IPIV contain the factored form of
*                  A.  AFP and IPIV will not be modified.
*          = 'N':  The matrix A will be copied to AFP and factored.
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
*          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
*          matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  NRHS    (input) INTEGER
*          The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
*          of the matrices B and X.  NRHS >= 0.
*
*  AP      (input) COMPLEX array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
*          The upper or lower triangle of the Hermitian matrix A, packed
*          columnwise in a linear array.  The j-th column of A is stored
*          in the array AP as follows:
*          if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
*          if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2*n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
*          See below for further details.
*
*  AFP     (input or output) COMPLEX array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
*          If FACT = 'F', then AFP is an input argument and on entry
*          contains the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used
*          to obtain the factor U or L from the factorization
*          A = U*D*U**H or A = L*D*L**H as computed by CHPTRF, stored as
*          a packed triangular matrix in the same storage format as A.
*
*          If FACT = 'N', then AFP is an output argument and on exit
*          contains the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used
*          to obtain the factor U or L from the factorization
*          A = U*D*U**H or A = L*D*L**H as computed by CHPTRF, stored as
*          a packed triangular matrix in the same storage format as A.
*
*  IPIV    (input or output) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*          If FACT = 'F', then IPIV is an input argument and on entry
*          contains details of the interchanges and the block structure
*          of D, as determined by CHPTRF.
*          If IPIV(k) > 0, then rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were
*          interchanged and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.
*          If UPLO = 'U' and IPIV(k) = IPIV(k-1) < 0, then rows and
*          columns k-1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k-1:k,k-1:k)
*          is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'L' and IPIV(k) =
*          IPIV(k+1) < 0, then rows and columns k+1 and -IPIV(k) were
*          interchanged and D(k:k+1,k:k+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.
*
*          If FACT = 'N', then IPIV is an output argument and on exit
*          contains details of the interchanges and the block structure
*          of D, as determined by CHPTRF.
*
*  B       (input) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
*          The N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.
*
*  LDB     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
*
*  X       (output) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
*          If INFO = 0 or INFO = N+1, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X.
*
*  LDX     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
*
*  RCOND   (output) REAL
*          The estimate of the reciprocal condition number of the matrix
*          A.  If RCOND is less than the machine precision (in
*          particular, if RCOND = 0), the matrix is singular to working
*          precision.  This condition is indicated by a return code of
*          INFO > 0.
*
*  FERR    (output) REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
*          The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
*          X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
*          If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
*          is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
*          element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
*          largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
*          the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight
*          overestimate of the true error.
*
*  BERR    (output) REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
*          The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
*          vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
*          any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).
*
*  WORK    (workspace) COMPLEX array, dimension (2*N)
*
*  RWORK   (workspace) REAL array, dimension (N)
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0: successful exit
*          < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0:  if INFO = i, and i is
*                <= N:  D(i,i) is exactly zero.  The factorization
*                       has been completed but the factor D is exactly
*                       singular, so the solution and error bounds could
*                       not be computed. RCOND = 0 is returned.
*                = N+1: D is nonsingular, but RCOND is less than machine
*                       precision, meaning that the matrix is singular
*                       to working precision.  Nevertheless, the
*                       solution and error bounds are computed because
*                       there are a number of situations where the
*                       computed solution can be more accurate than the
*                       value of RCOND would suggest.
*

*  Further Details
*  ===============
*
*  The packed storage scheme is illustrated by the following example
*  when N = 4, UPLO = 'U':
*
*  Two-dimensional storage of the Hermitian matrix A:
*
*     a11 a12 a13 a14
*         a22 a23 a24
*             a33 a34     (aij = conjg(aji))
*                 a44
*
*  Packed storage of the upper triangle of A:
*
*  AP = [ a11, a12, a22, a13, a23, a33, a14, a24, a34, a44 ]

      SUBROUTINE CHPGVX( ITYPE, JOBZ, RANGE, UPLO, N, AP, BP, VL, VU, IL, IU, ABSTOL, M, W, Z, LDZ, WORK, RWORK, IWORK, IFAIL, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  CHPGVX computes selected eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors
*  of a complex generalized Hermitian-definite eigenproblem, of the form
*  A*x=(lambda)*B*x,  A*Bx=(lambda)*x,  or B*A*x=(lambda)*x.  Here A and
*  B are assumed to be Hermitian, stored in packed format, and B is also
*  positive definite.  Eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be selected by
*  specifying either a range of values or a range of indices for the
*  desired eigenvalues.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  ITYPE   (input) INTEGER
*          Specifies the problem type to be solved:
*          = 1:  A*x = (lambda)*B*x
*          = 2:  A*B*x = (lambda)*x
*          = 3:  B*A*x = (lambda)*x

*
*  AP      (input/output) COMPLEX array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
*          On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the Hermitian matrix
*          A, packed columnwise in a linear array.  The j-th column of A
*          is stored in the array AP as follows:
*          if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
*          if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2*n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
*
*          On exit, the contents of AP are destroyed.

*          if UPLO = 'L', BP(i + (j-1)*(2*n-j)/2) = B(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
*
*          On exit, the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky

*  IU      (input) INTEGER
*          If RANGE='I', the indices (in ascending order) of the

*          1 <= IL <= IU <= N, if N > 0; IL = 1 and IU = 0 if N = 0.
*          Not referenced if RANGE = 'A' or 'V'.
*
*  ABSTOL  (input) REAL
*          The absolute error tolerance for the eigenvalues.
*          An approximate eigenvalue is accepted as converged
*          when it is determined to lie in an interval [a,b]
*          of width less than or equal to
*
*                  ABSTOL + EPS *   max( |a|,|b| ) ,
*
*          where EPS is the machine precision.  If ABSTOL is less than
*          or equal to zero, then  EPS*|T|  will be used in its place,
*          where |T| is the 1-norm of the tridiagonal matrix obtained
*          by reducing AP to tridiagonal form.
*
*          Eigenvalues will be computed most accurately when ABSTOL is
*          set to twice the underflow threshold 2*SLAMCH('S'), not zero.
*          If this routine returns with INFO>0, indicating that some
*          eigenvectors did not converge, try setting ABSTOL to
*          2*SLAMCH('S').
*
*  M       (output) INTEGER

*          If RANGE = 'A', M = N, and if RANGE = 'I', M = IU-IL+1.
*
*  W       (output) REAL array, dimension (N)
*          On normal exit, the first M elements contain the selected
*          eigenvalues in ascending order.
*
*  Z       (output) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDZ, N)
*          If JOBZ = 'N', then Z is not referenced.
*          If JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, the first M columns of Z
*          contain the orthonormal eigenvectors of the matrix A
*          corresponding to the selected eigenvalues, with the i-th
*          column of Z holding the eigenvector associated with W(i).
*          The eigenvectors are normalized as follows:
*          if ITYPE = 1 or 2, Z**H*B*Z = I;
*          if ITYPE = 3, Z**H*inv(B)*Z = I.
*
*          If an eigenvector fails to converge, then that column of Z
*          contains the latest approximation to the eigenvector, and the
*          index of the eigenvector is returned in IFAIL.
*          Note: the user must ensure that at least max(1,M) columns are
*          supplied in the array Z; if RANGE = 'V', the exact value of M
*          is not known in advance and an upper bound must be used.
*
*  LDZ     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDZ >= 1, and if
*          JOBZ = 'V', LDZ >= max(1,N).

*  RWORK   (workspace) REAL array, dimension (7*N)
*

*  IFAIL   (output) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*          If JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, the first M elements of
*          IFAIL are zero.  If INFO > 0, then IFAIL contains the
*          indices of the eigenvectors that failed to converge.
*          If JOBZ = 'N', then IFAIL is not referenced.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0:  CPPTRF or CHPEVX returned an error code:
*             <= N:  if INFO = i, CHPEVX failed to converge;
*                    i eigenvectors failed to converge.  Their indices
*                    are stored in array IFAIL.
*             > N:   if INFO = N + i, for 1 <= i <= n, then the leading
*                    minor of order i of B is not positive definite.
*                    The factorization of B could not be completed and

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE CHPEVD( JOBZ, UPLO, N, AP, W, Z, LDZ, WORK, LWORK, RWORK, LRWORK, IWORK, LIWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  CHPEVD computes all the eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors of
*  a complex Hermitian matrix A in packed storage.  If eigenvectors are
*  desired, it uses a divide and conquer algorithm.
*
*  The divide and conquer algorithm makes very mild assumptions about
*  floating point arithmetic. It will work on machines with a guard
*  digit in add/subtract, or on those binary machines without guard
*  digits which subtract like the Cray X-MP, Cray Y-MP, Cray C-90, or
*  Cray-2. It could conceivably fail on hexadecimal or decimal machines
*  without guard digits, but we know of none.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  JOBZ    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'N':  Compute eigenvalues only;
*          = 'V':  Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
*          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  AP      (input/output) COMPLEX array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
*          On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the Hermitian matrix
*          A, packed columnwise in a linear array.  The j-th column of A
*          is stored in the array AP as follows:
*          if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
*          if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2*n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
*
*          On exit, AP is overwritten by values generated during the
*          reduction to tridiagonal form.  If UPLO = 'U', the diagonal
*          and first superdiagonal of the tridiagonal matrix T overwrite
*          the corresponding elements of A, and if UPLO = 'L', the
*          diagonal and first subdiagonal of T overwrite the
*          corresponding elements of A.

*          If JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, Z contains the orthonormal
*          eigenvectors of the matrix A, with the i-th column of Z
*          holding the eigenvector associated with W(i).

*
*  LDZ     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDZ >= 1, and if
*          JOBZ = 'V', LDZ >= max(1,N).
*
*  WORK    (workspace/output) COMPLEX array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the required LWORK.
*
*  LWORK   (input) INTEGER
*          The dimension of array WORK.
*          If N <= 1,               LWORK must be at least 1.
*          If JOBZ = 'N' and N > 1, LWORK must be at least N.
*          If JOBZ = 'V' and N > 1, LWORK must be at least 2*N.
*
*          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
*          only calculates the required sizes of the WORK, RWORK and
*          IWORK arrays, returns these values as the first entries of
*          the WORK, RWORK and IWORK arrays, and no error message
*          related to LWORK or LRWORK or LIWORK is issued by XERBLA.
*
*  RWORK   (workspace/output) REAL array, dimension (MAX(1,LRWORK))
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, RWORK(1) returns the required LRWORK.
*
*  LRWORK  (input) INTEGER
*          The dimension of array RWORK.
*          If N <= 1,               LRWORK must be at least 1.
*          If JOBZ = 'N' and N > 1, LRWORK must be at least N.
*          If JOBZ = 'V' and N > 1, LRWORK must be at least
*                    1 + 5*N + 2*N**2.
*
*          If LRWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the
*          routine only calculates the required sizes of the WORK, RWORK
*          and IWORK arrays, returns these values as the first entries
*          of the WORK, RWORK and IWORK arrays, and no error message
*          related to LWORK or LRWORK or LIWORK is issued by XERBLA.
*
*  IWORK   (workspace/output) INTEGER array, dimension (MAX(1,LIWORK))
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, IWORK(1) returns the required LIWORK.
*
*  LIWORK  (input) INTEGER
*          The dimension of array IWORK.
*          If JOBZ  = 'N' or N <= 1, LIWORK must be at least 1.
*          If JOBZ  = 'V' and N > 1, LIWORK must be at least 3 + 5*N.
*
*          If LIWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the
*          routine only calculates the required sizes of the WORK, RWORK
*          and IWORK arrays, returns these values as the first entries
*          of the WORK, RWORK and IWORK arrays, and no error message
*          related to LWORK or LRWORK or LIWORK is issued by XERBLA.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
*          > 0:  if INFO = i, the algorithm failed to converge; i
*                off-diagonal elements of an intermediate tridiagonal
*                form did not converge to zero.
