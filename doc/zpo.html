*  ZPOSV computes the solution to a complex system of linear equations
*     A * X = B,
*  where A is an N-by-N Hermitian positive definite matrix and X and B
*  are N-by-NRHS matrices.

*  The Cholesky decomposition is used to factor A as
*     A = U**H* U,  if UPLO = 'U', or
*     A = L * L**H,  if UPLO = 'L',
*  where U is an upper triangular matrix and  L is a lower triangular
*  matrix.  The factored form of A is then used to solve the system of
*  equations A * X = B.

*          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
*          triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the

*          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
*          triangular part of A is not referenced.

*          > 0:  if INFO = i, the leading minor of order i of A is not
*                positive definite, so the factorization could not be
*                completed, and the solution has not been computed.

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  ZPOEQU computes row and column scalings intended to equilibrate a
*  Hermitian positive definite matrix A and reduce its condition number
*  (with respect to the two-norm).  S contains the scale factors,
*  S(i) = 1/sqrt(A(i,i)), chosen so that the scaled matrix B with
*  elements B(i,j) = S(i)*A(i,j)*S(j) has ones on the diagonal.  This

*  smallest possible condition number over all possible diagonal
*  scalings.

*          If INFO = 0, S contains the scale factors for A.
*
*  SCOND   (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          If INFO = 0, S contains the ratio of the smallest S(i) to

*          large nor too small, it is not worth scaling by S.
*

*          Absolute value of largest matrix element.  If AMAX is very
*          close to overflow or very close to underflow, the matrix
*          should be scaled.

      SUBROUTINE ZPOSVX( FACT, UPLO, N, NRHS, A, LDA, AF, LDAF, EQUED, S, B, LDB, X, LDX, RCOND, FERR, BERR, WORK, RWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  ZPOSVX uses the Cholesky factorization A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H to
*  compute the solution to a complex system of linear equations
*     A * X = B,
*  where A is an N-by-N Hermitian positive definite matrix and X and B
*  are N-by-NRHS matrices.
*
*  Error bounds on the solution and a condition estimate are also
*  provided.
*
*  Description
*  ===========
*
*  The following steps are performed:
*
*  1. If FACT = 'E', real scaling factors are computed to equilibrate
*     the system:
*        diag(S) * A * diag(S) * inv(diag(S)) * X = diag(S) * B
*     Whether or not the system will be equilibrated depends on the
*     scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, A is
*     overwritten by diag(S)*A*diag(S) and B by diag(S)*B.
*
*  2. If FACT = 'N' or 'E', the Cholesky decomposition is used to
*     factor the matrix A (after equilibration if FACT = 'E') as
*        A = U**H* U,  if UPLO = 'U', or
*        A = L * L**H,  if UPLO = 'L',
*     where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is a lower triangular
*     matrix.
*
*  3. If the leading i-by-i principal minor is not positive definite,
*     then the routine returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored
*     form of A is used to estimate the condition number of the matrix
*     A.  If the reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine
*     precision, INFO = N+1 is returned as a warning, but the routine
*     still goes on to solve for X and compute error bounds as
*     described below.
*
*  4. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
*     of A.
*
*  5. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution
*     matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates
*     for it.
*
*  6. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by
*     diag(S) so that it solves the original system before
*     equilibration.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  FACT    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies whether or not the factored form of the matrix A is
*          supplied on entry, and if not, whether the matrix A should be
*          equilibrated before it is factored.
*          = 'F':  On entry, AF contains the factored form of A.
*                  If EQUED = 'Y', the matrix A has been equilibrated
*                  with scaling factors given by S.  A and AF will not
*                  be modified.
*          = 'N':  The matrix A will be copied to AF and factored.
*          = 'E':  The matrix A will be equilibrated if necessary, then
*                  copied to AF and factored.
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
*          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
*          matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  NRHS    (input) INTEGER
*          The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
*          of the matrices B and X.  NRHS >= 0.
*
*  A       (input/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          On entry, the Hermitian matrix A, except if FACT = 'F' and
*          EQUED = 'Y', then A must contain the equilibrated matrix
*          diag(S)*A*diag(S).  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
*          N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the upper
*          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
*          triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
*          leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
*          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
*          triangular part of A is not referenced.  A is not modified if
*          FACT = 'F' or 'N', or if FACT = 'E' and EQUED = 'N' on exit.
*
*          On exit, if FACT = 'E' and EQUED = 'Y', A is overwritten by
*          diag(S)*A*diag(S).
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
*
*  AF      (input or output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDAF,N)
*          If FACT = 'F', then AF is an input argument and on entry
*          contains the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky
*          factorization A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H, in the same storage
*          format as A.  If EQUED .ne. 'N', then AF is the factored form
*          of the equilibrated matrix diag(S)*A*diag(S).
*
*          If FACT = 'N', then AF is an output argument and on exit
*          returns the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky
*          factorization A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H of the original
*          matrix A.
*
*          If FACT = 'E', then AF is an output argument and on exit
*          returns the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky
*          factorization A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H of the equilibrated
*          matrix A (see the description of A for the form of the
*          equilibrated matrix).
*
*  LDAF    (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array AF.  LDAF >= max(1,N).
*
*  EQUED   (input or output) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies the form of equilibration that was done.
*          = 'N':  No equilibration (always true if FACT = 'N').
*          = 'Y':  Equilibration was done, i.e., A has been replaced by
*                  diag(S) * A * diag(S).
*          EQUED is an input argument if FACT = 'F'; otherwise, it is an
*          output argument.
*
*  S       (input or output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          The scale factors for A; not accessed if EQUED = 'N'.  S is
*          an input argument if FACT = 'F'; otherwise, S is an output
*          argument.  If FACT = 'F' and EQUED = 'Y', each element of S
*          must be positive.
*
*  B       (input/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
*          On entry, the N-by-NRHS righthand side matrix B.
*          On exit, if EQUED = 'N', B is not modified; if EQUED = 'Y',
*          B is overwritten by diag(S) * B.
*
*  LDB     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
*
*  X       (output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
*          If INFO = 0 or INFO = N+1, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X to
*          the original system of equations.  Note that if EQUED = 'Y',
*          A and B are modified on exit, and the solution to the
*          equilibrated system is inv(diag(S))*X.
*
*  LDX     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
*
*  RCOND   (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The estimate of the reciprocal condition number of the matrix
*          A after equilibration (if done).  If RCOND is less than the
*          machine precision (in particular, if RCOND = 0), the matrix
*          is singular to working precision.  This condition is
*          indicated by a return code of INFO > 0.
*
*  FERR    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
*          The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
*          X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
*          If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
*          is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
*          element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
*          largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
*          the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight
*          overestimate of the true error.
*
*  BERR    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
*          The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
*          vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
*          any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).
*
*  WORK    (workspace) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (2*N)
*
*  RWORK   (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0: successful exit
*          < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0: if INFO = i, and i is
*                <= N:  the leading minor of order i of A is
*                       not positive definite, so the factorization
*                       could not be completed, and the solution has not
*                       been computed. RCOND = 0 is returned.
*                = N+1: U is nonsingular, but RCOND is less than machine
*                       precision, meaning that the matrix is singular
*                       to working precision.  Nevertheless, the
*                       solution and error bounds are computed because
*                       there are a number of situations where the
*                       computed solution can be more accurate than the
*                       value of RCOND would suggest.
