FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE DSBEVD( JOBZ, UPLO, N, KD, AB, LDAB, W, Z, LDZ, WORK, LWORK, IWORK, LIWORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DSBEVD computes all the eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors of
*  a real symmetric band matrix A. If eigenvectors are desired, it uses
*  a divide and conquer algorithm.
*
*  The divide and conquer algorithm makes very mild assumptions about
*  floating point arithmetic. It will work on machines with a guard
*  digit in add/subtract, or on those binary machines without guard
*  digits which subtract like the Cray X-MP, Cray Y-MP, Cray C-90, or
*  Cray-2. It could conceivably fail on hexadecimal or decimal machines
*  without guard digits, but we know of none.

*
*  AB      (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDAB, N)
*          On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the symmetric band
*          matrix A, stored in the first KD+1 rows of the array.  The
*          j-th column of A is stored in the j-th column of the array AB
*          as follows:
*          if UPLO = 'U', AB(kd+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-kd)<=i<=j;

*          eigenvectors of the matrix A, with the i-th column of Z
*          holding the eigenvector associated with W(i).

*
*  LDZ     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDZ >= 1, and if

*
*          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
*          only calculates the optimal sizes of the WORK and IWORK
*          arrays, returns these values as the first entries of the WORK

*  Purpose
*  =======

*  The divide and conquer algorithm makes very mild assumptions about

*  digit in add/subtract, or on those binary machines without guard
*  digits which subtract like the Cray X-MP, Cray Y-MP, Cray C-90, or

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE DSBTRD( VECT, UPLO, N, KD, AB, LDAB, D, E, Q, LDQ, WORK, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DSBTRD reduces a real symmetric band matrix A to symmetric
*  tridiagonal form T by an orthogonal similarity transformation:
*  Q**T * A * Q = T.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  VECT    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'N':  do not form Q;
*          = 'V':  form Q;
*          = 'U':  update a matrix X, by forming X*Q.
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
*          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  KD      (input) INTEGER
*          The number of superdiagonals of the matrix A if UPLO = 'U',
*          or the number of subdiagonals if UPLO = 'L'.  KD >= 0.
*
*  AB      (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDAB,N)
*          On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the symmetric band
*          matrix A, stored in the first KD+1 rows of the array.  The
*          j-th column of A is stored in the j-th column of the array AB
*          as follows:
*          if UPLO = 'U', AB(kd+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-kd)<=i<=j;
*          if UPLO = 'L', AB(1+i-j,j)    = A(i,j) for j<=i<=min(n,j+kd).
*          On exit, the diagonal elements of AB are overwritten by the
*          diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix T; if KD > 0, the
*          elements on the first superdiagonal (if UPLO = 'U') or the
*          first subdiagonal (if UPLO = 'L') are overwritten by the
*          off-diagonal elements of T; the rest of AB is overwritten by
*          values generated during the reduction.
*
*  LDAB    (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= KD+1.
*
*  D       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          The diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix T.
*
*  E       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1)
*          The off-diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix T:
*          E(i) = T(i,i+1) if UPLO = 'U'; E(i) = T(i+1,i) if UPLO = 'L'.
*
*  Q       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDQ,N)
*          On entry, if VECT = 'U', then Q must contain an N-by-N
*          matrix X; if VECT = 'N' or 'V', then Q need not be set.
*
*          On exit:
*          if VECT = 'V', Q contains the N-by-N orthogonal matrix Q;
*          if VECT = 'U', Q contains the product X*Q;
*          if VECT = 'N', the array Q is not referenced.
*
*  LDQ     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array Q.
*          LDQ >= 1, and LDQ >= N if VECT = 'V' or 'U'.
*
*  WORK    (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
