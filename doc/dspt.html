*  =======
*
*  DSPTRD reduces a real symmetric matrix A stored in packed form to
*  symmetric tridiagonal form T by an orthogonal similarity
*  transformation: Q**T * A * Q = T.
*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
*          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  AP      (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
*          On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the symmetric matrix
*          A, packed columnwise in a linear array.  The j-th column of A
*          is stored in the array AP as follows:
*          if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
*          if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2*n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
*          On exit, if UPLO = 'U', the diagonal and first superdiagonal
*          of A are overwritten by the corresponding elements of the
*          tridiagonal matrix T, and the elements above the first
*          superdiagonal, with the array TAU, represent the orthogonal
*          matrix Q as a product of elementary reflectors; if UPLO
*          = 'L', the diagonal and first subdiagonal of A are over-
*          written by the corresponding elements of the tridiagonal
*          matrix T, and the elements below the first subdiagonal, with
*          the array TAU, represent the orthogonal matrix Q as a product
*          of elementary reflectors. See Further Details.
*
*  D       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          The diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix T:
*          D(i) = A(i,i).

*          E(i) = A(i,i+1) if UPLO = 'U', E(i) = A(i+1,i) if UPLO = 'L'.
*
*  TAU     (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1)
*          The scalar factors of the elementary reflectors (see Further
*          Details).
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*

*  Further Details
*  ===============
*
*  If UPLO = 'U', the matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary
*  reflectors
*
*     Q = H(n-1) . . . H(2) H(1).
*
*  Each H(i) has the form
*
*     H(i) = I - tau * v * v'
*
*  where tau is a real scalar, and v is a real vector with
*  v(i+1:n) = 0 and v(i) = 1; v(1:i-1) is stored on exit in AP,
*  overwriting A(1:i-1,i+1), and tau is stored in TAU(i).
*
*  If UPLO = 'L', the matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary
*  reflectors
*
*     Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(n-1).
*
*  Each H(i) has the form
*
*     H(i) = I - tau * v * v'
*
*  where tau is a real scalar, and v is a real vector with
*  v(1:i) = 0 and v(i+1) = 1; v(i+2:n) is stored on exit in AP,
*  overwriting A(i+2:n,i), and tau is stored in TAU(i).

FORTRAN MANUAL
      SUBROUTINE DSPTRF( UPLO, N, AP, IPIV, INFO )

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DSPTRF computes the factorization of a real symmetric matrix A stored
*  in packed format using the Bunch-Kaufman diagonal pivoting method:
*
*     A = U*D*U**T  or  A = L*D*L**T
*
*  where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
*  triangular matrices, and D is symmetric and block diagonal with

*

*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
*          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.

*          On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the symmetric matrix
*          A, packed columnwise in a linear array.  The j-th column of A
*          is stored in the array AP as follows:
*          if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
*          if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
*
*          On exit, the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used
*          to obtain the factor U or L, stored as a packed triangular
*          matrix overwriting A (see below for further details).
*
*  IPIV    (output) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*          Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D.
*          If IPIV(k) > 0, then rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were
*          interchanged and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.
*          If UPLO = 'U' and IPIV(k) = IPIV(k-1) < 0, then rows and
*          columns k-1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k-1:k,k-1:k)
*          is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'L' and IPIV(k) =
*          IPIV(k+1) < 0, then rows and columns k+1 and -IPIV(k) were
*          interchanged and D(k:k+1,k:k+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0: successful exit
*          < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0: if INFO = i, D(i,i) is exactly zero.  The factorization
*               has been completed, but the block diagonal matrix D is
*               exactly singular, and division by zero will occur if it
*               is used to solve a system of equations.

*  i.e., U is a product of terms P(k)*U(k), where k decreases from n to
*  1 in steps of 1 or 2, and D is a block diagonal matrix with 1-by-1
*  and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks D(k).  P(k) is a permutation matrix as
*  defined by IPIV(k), and U(k) is a unit upper triangular matrix, such
*  that if the diagonal block D(k) is of order s (s = 1 or 2), then

*
*  If s = 1, D(k) overwrites A(k,k), and v overwrites A(1:k-1,k).

*  and A(k,k), and v overwrites A(1:k-2,k-1:k).
*
*  If UPLO = 'L', then A = L*D*L', where
*     L = P(1)*L(1)* ... *P(k)*L(k)* ...,
*  i.e., L is a product of terms P(k)*L(k), where k increases from 1 to

*
*  If s = 1, D(k) overwrites A(k,k), and v overwrites A(k+1:n,k).
*  If s = 2, the lower triangle of D(k) overwrites A(k,k), A(k+1,k),
